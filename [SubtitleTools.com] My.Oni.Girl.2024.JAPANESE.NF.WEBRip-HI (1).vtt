Yup! My boyfriend, Yatsuse.

you'd bring your boyfriend,

I didn't think you were telling the truth.

[girl 3] To be honest, I kinda thought
you'd let a lie get out of hand.

[girl 2] Is he a first year too?
Did you meet in class?

- [Ai] We're in different classes.
- [girl 1] Who made the first move?

- Spill it.
- [Ai] Well, uh...

Well, they know we're not dating.
I mean, how could they not?

I guess I asked too much of you.

- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.820
I shouldn't have asked you
to do something so weird.

Especially if I'm right that
you never had a real girlfriend before?

- I see.

try to take good care of her.

waiting on you.

- [Hiiragi] Uh...

- [Hiiragi] Scuse me?
- [girl] Uh?

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.411
I don't mind covering her bus fare.
I... if that's okay?

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.455
What is this? Are you with her?

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.915
[Hiiragi] Yeah, I am.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.666
- [girl] Nu-uh!
- Okay. Perfect.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.668
It's fine. I can just walk.

Uh... well... you looked like you needed help.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.817
- I was doing just fine on my own.
- Ah.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.443
Mm, course you were.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.154
- I guess I just felt like being nosy.
- [bubbling]

[gasps]

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.450
Anyway, I'd better head on home now.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.285
Be careful on your walk!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.957
- [girl] Oh!
- Hm?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.417
I just remembered!

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.503
- I actually <i>do</i> need someone's help.
- Hm?

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.215
[Hiiragi] So... what's your name?

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:07.301
- Tsumugi. What's yours?
- Hiiragi.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.345

{\an8}It's not weird
that I accepted your invite, is it?

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.270
What? You definitely invited yourself.

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:20.565
- Oh. That how it seemed?
- Uh-uh-uh... It... it doesn't matter.

[Tsumugi] Aw! It's eating it! [chuckles]

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.531
I'm glad you dropped in
before I started making dinner.

- You're makin' us croquettes, right?
- Mm-hmm.

you pull out all the stops.

- [Mom] What? You aren't?
- [girl] I see.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.878
[Mom] Well you should stay
for dinner anyway, all right?

Hiiragi's girlfriend.

[Mom] Apparently not.

- Welcome home.
- Oh, hey there, son.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.353
So, you left home to find this person,

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.772
and you've been wandering
far and wide ever since?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.984
Yeah. There's something
I need to give them.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.819
To give them?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.280
- Here come my freshly fried croquettes!
- [girl gasps]

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:10.841
Mmm. That bath was so relaxing.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.094
Ah, mind if I borrow you for a second?

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.722
Great. Now, sit down.

00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:20.601
You mind if I brush your hair?

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.860
[chuckles softly]
Your hair's as soft and fine as it looks.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:33.030
I'm... glad you think so.
[chuckles nervously]

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:37.368
When I was your age,
my hair was just as unruly as Hiiragi's.

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.621
My mom would set me down
and tame it with her brush.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.666
[Tsumugi] Really?
Your hair doesn't look unruly at all now.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.209
[Mom] It did calm down.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:49.463
Oh! Hey, Hiiragi.
About that talk we had earlier.

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:52.383
I just hired a tutor
who can work with you right here at home.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.885
So you don't need cram school anymore!

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.387
What?! Why'd you do that?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.513
Why wouldn't I?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.391
You're obviously gonna get
a lot more out of private lessons.

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:03.394
Hold on. I already applied
for the summer course.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.771
Then it sounds like you'll have to cancel.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.149
- I could. But everyone else...
- Forget them!

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:09.984
You're your own person, aren't you?

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.778
You <i>think</i> you wanna go to cram school,

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:16.282
but that's just because you feel like
it's safer to follow everyone else.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:17.199
No, that isn't...

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.785
[man, impatiently] Just listen
and do as I say,

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.037
and you can't go wrong.

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:22.788
Understood?

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.041
[Hiiragi grunts, sighs]

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:27.043
[tense music playing]

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:29.211
Huh? Hiiragi?

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.546
[bottle cap tinkling]

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.547
Hmm.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.633
- Hello? Tsumugi?
- [door opens, shuts]

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.177
- [Tsumugi] I'm in here.
- Oh. Okay.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.304
Good. We're all done.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.515
- [girl] You wanna play a game?
- Yeah. Sounds good.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.309
Thanks for doing this.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.565
[sighs]

00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:53.694
Uh. Oh... Uh... [sighs]

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.738
Stupid screw-up.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.323
[gasps]

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.326

[both groaning]

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.706
[girl] Whoa!

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.666
[laughs]

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.668
You've lost three times in a row now!

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.711
Let me just try <i>one</i> more time.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:15.465
Huh?

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:20.096
[Hiiragi] It's cold.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.347
[moans softly]

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.640
[bubbling]

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:24.850
Snow?

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.939
[unsettling music plays]

[growls]

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.860
[gasps] What the...

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.363
[hyperventilating]

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:40.116

[whimpering]

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.786
- Huh!
- Hm?

00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:45.286
What's the matter?

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.081
[Tsumugi] I need the toilet!

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:48.999
But there's one downstairs!

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.210
[Tsumugi gasps] So cold!

00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:54.672
It's frozen shut?

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.381
Hey, Hiiragi!

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.592
[music intensifies]

00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:01.262
[bubbling]

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:02.471
What the heck is this?

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.014
[gasps]

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.101
[creature wails]

[creature wails]

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.654
Hiiragi! Get it together!

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.905
We need to run!

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.240
Uh... Tsumugi?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.160
[Tsumugi] Come on! This way!

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.078
[dramatic music playing]

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:33.919

[Hiiragi panting]

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.766
[groans]

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.187
I think we're safe for the time being.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.189
Just what the heck... <i>was</i> that thing?

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.024
I don't know enough to guess.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.277
I'm trying to figure out
why it went after you.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.695
- Tsumugi...
- Hm?

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.323
You, uh, seem to have grown a horn.

00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:04.074
What is that?

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.035
Oh, so you're able to see it now.

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.412
I've... got a horn

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:10.456
because I'm an oni.

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:11.373
[gasps]

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.917
And the reason I've come here

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.420
is to eat you, Hiiragi.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.214
[gasps]

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:19.590
<i>Just</i> kidding!

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.509
I would never eat a person.

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:24.720
I really am an oni though. Are ya spooked?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.597
Uh... No, why would I be?

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.474
Huh? [gasps]

00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:30.059
[bubbling]

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.646
[gasping] N... not again!

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.565
Relax. They're called mini-oni.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.235
I've never seen
such a dense cluster before.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.444
You don't say.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:44.281
[Tsumugi] They tend to leak out of people
who try to keep their feelings bottled up.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.825
You know, people like you.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.244
- So that thing's an oni?
- It sure is.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.996
And its proof that
you're hiding your fear.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.790
I don't have to hide anything!

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:54.415
[grunts]

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:57.002
[gasps] Hey! [grunts]

00:13:57.086 --> 00:14:00.589
- Get back here!
- [Tsumugi laughing loudly]

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:04.927
- So where'd you come from, Tsumugi?
- Across the mountain.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:08.347
It's a place where oni live
called the Hidden Village.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.933
I left there because I wanna find my mom.

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:15.813
She ran away when I was little
and left my dad and me all by ourselves.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.734
He did his best to raise me on his own.
But things were pretty hard for us.

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.486
She sounds irresponsible, right?

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.573
I was thinking
of giving her a punch to the jaw!

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:31.537
Seems like you might
give her a few punches.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620
Right?

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:34.832
And she should be
at a shrine in this world.

00:14:35.332 --> 00:14:37.459
Hm? No! It's gone!

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.169
- Uh...
- Oh.

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:40.921
I really can't afford to lose it!

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.715
- Without it, I... [moans]
- Oh!

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:44.550
[Tsumugi groaning]

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.302
You mean this?

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.385
Yeah!

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.138
Oh, thank goodness.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.765
Sorry. I should've
given it back to you sooner.

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.517
Found it in my room.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.936
- It's from Hie Shrine, right?
- Uh?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.855
- That's a ways away.
- [shakily] Huh?

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.984
- You mean, you know where it is?!
- Uh... Mm.

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:05.487
[moans] Hiiragi, I... I need your help.

00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:08.324
You gotta guide me
to the Hie Shrine, okay?

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.119
[gasps] I don't think I can.
I have to go to school tomorrow.

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.329
And my parents...

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:16.790
{\an8}The thing is, I just don't know
my way around in your world.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:17.874
So please help!

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.919
I want you to come with me, Hiiragi!

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.088
[echoing clang]

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:29.303
I guess... never mind.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:30.888
Sorry for asking for too much.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.683
- [Hiiragi] It's okay.
- Huh?

00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:36.684
I'll help you.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.103
Awesome!

00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:40.064
[tapping door gently]

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:41.147
Uh, Hiiragi?

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.734
Is Tsumugi with you? Oh!

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.946
What happened?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.743
Hey, Mom! Hiiragi's gone too!

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.037
[playful music playing]

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.586
So why go to Hie Shrine?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.714
Because the last time she talked
to my dad before she ditched us,

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:09.426
my mom said that's where she was gonna go.
That's the only lead I've got.

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:14.223
Have any guesses as to why
I've gained the ability to see mini-oni?

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:17.476
Well, the more like an oni you become,
the more of us you can see.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.061
[Hiiragi] But I'm not an oni.

00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:22.731
[Tsumugi] Humans who leak
lots of mini-oni become oni over time.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.609
And you've been leaking
some seriously tense ones.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.236
I bet you'll turn any moment now.

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.319
[groans]

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:30.239
I will?!

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:34.284
Uh... Wait a second, d... does that mean
you started out as a human?

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.787
No. I've been an oni
since the day I was born.

00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:40.082
[gentle music playing]

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:47.840
[music continues]

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.760
[birds chirping]

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.273
[both panting]

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.404
- [gasps softly] The sun's rising.
- Huh?

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:16.784
[Tsumugi gasps]

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.125
- [inhales sharply] It's pretty!
- Hmm.

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:28.922
[music fades out]

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:31.925
[Mom] It's already morning.

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.594
So it is.

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:38.557
I'll go see
if I can't track him down somehow.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.268
- You stay here in case he comes back.
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:49.902
[Tsumugi moaning] Hiiragi!

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.904
I'm exhausted!

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:58.452
- Wanna look for a place to rest?
- [Tsumugi] Why don't we take a car?

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.829
Because we're broke. And taxis cost money.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.372
Oh! That's right!

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:05.209
We could just hitchhike
with someone who's heading to Yonezawa!

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:09.463
Uh... I think people are too scared
to give rides to strangers these days.

00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:12.341
The only way to find out
for a fact is to give it a try.

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:13.258
I get that.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:16.845
Even if someone does pull over for us,
how'll we know we can trust them?

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.348
You sure are full of reasons
<i>not</i> to do things.

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.265
Fine.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.935
You keep on walking,
and I'll hitchhike without you.

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.729
- We'll meet back up at the destination.
- Huh?!

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:35.155
[softly] Hm.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.581
- Why are you following me?
- 'Cause you left me no choice.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.542
[mini-oni bubbling]

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.710
- Liar.
- [Hiiragi] I'm not lying!

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:02.933
What's that kid playing at? Good grief.

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.476
[Tsumugi] <i>No, you do it like this!</i>

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.728
You really gotta stick
your thumbs out there!

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.064
[groaning] Wait. Hold on!

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.984
They're as "out there" as they can be!

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:16.238
Mm, can't be helped.
I'll do this myself. [sighs]

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.739
Get out of my way.

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.324
[Hiiragi groaning] W... wait!

00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:25.289
[Hiiragi groans]

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.166
[woman laughing]

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.209
You two aren't trying
to hitchhike, are ya?

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.460
Yeah, we sure are.

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.381
[man] Sorry we can't take ya further.

00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:38.385
Don't be. Getting a lift to this town
means we'll be halfway to <i>our</i> destination.

00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:41.263
So, tell me, are the two of you
on a lovers' getaway or what?

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.182
- No. No way.
- No, it's not like that.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.641
[both laughing]

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.644
Well, don't you think
your parents are gonna worry?

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:49.730
Uh. Well, I guess they might.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.149
All of these bags...

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:54.067
Hey, why do you have all this stuff?

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.487
Ah, we wanna start
a vintage clothing store.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.532
For now, it's fully mobile.
We move between different flea markets.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.410
But today, we're doing a stall
in a park in Yonezawa.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:06.163
I know! You two
should come hang out for a bit!

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.051
Just... a little further left, yeah?

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.428
Right there. Good job.

00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:24.223
That's great. Way easier to see.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:25.807
Wow, you sell a lot of things.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.727
Mm, there's a festival
goin' on nearby as well,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.729
so we're goin' after the kimono crowd.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.524
Excuse me.
Do you have this shirt in a smaller size?

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.568
Nah, we only have the sizes on display.

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.695
But we do have smaller shirts
in different patterns.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.698
- [Tsumugi] Hiiragi!
- [girl] Gotcha. This one's cute too!

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:43.742
When are we getting out of this place?

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:47.537
We owe them for giving us a ride,
so we gotta help them a bit to say thanks.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.958
Don't worry about it.
They were driving this way anyway.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.584
But we... can't just...

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.836
- [man 1] Hiiragi. Oh, and Tsumugi.
- Huh?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.756
I need to go
to the information desk for a little bit.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.758
You two mind lookin' after the stall?

00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:01.551
- [Hiiragi] Uh, no prob.
- Thank you.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:04.096
You can charge a bit less
than what's on the tags.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.806
You're in charge now!

00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:07.975
- Just leave it to us!
- [groans]

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.893
[man 2] Excuse me.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:13.939
Let's say I pick up two of these.
Would that get me a discount?

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:17.693
[Hiiragi] Uh, that's right.
It's a hundred yen off when you buy two.

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:20.821
How about this shirt?
Can I try it as well?

00:21:20.904 --> 00:21:22.114
Yeah. Here you go.

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.867
[man 2] This is nice.
All right. I'll take this, and...

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.120
I hope you realize how beautiful you are.

00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:29.204
[woman] You're cute.

00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:32.082
[coins jingle, tin rattles]

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:33.667
[indistinct chatter]

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.587
Wow, that's amazing.
You must be really smart.

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.798
[man 3 laughing] Honestly? No, not at all!

00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.718
Mio is... not very interested in the stall.

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:47.973
Excuse me. This hat,
do you mind if my kid tries it on?

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.142
Oh, sure. Go for it.

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:53.687
- Hey. Cool if I grab one of those?
- Yeah. You want a bandana?

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.023
- So cute! I want it!
- [mother chuckles softly]

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.024
Catch!

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:04.364
There. Things have finally calmed down.

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:06.199
You two were a massive help today.

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:07.993
I know it's not much of a reward,

00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:10.954
but if any of this caught your eye,
feel free to take it.

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.039
That's really okay?

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.122
Awesome!

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:20.756
Seems like Ryuji and Mio
have been avoiding making eye contact.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.924
Do you think they might be having a fight?

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.595
No. If you ask me,
it seems like they're always like this.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.889
And no one can understand
a couple's problems

00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:30.432
except the couple themselves.

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:34.311
That may be true, but I still wish
we could do something for them.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.147
You really wanna get
in the middle of that?

00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:40.817
Don't be pushy. You hate it when
your dad acts like he knows what you want

00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:42.069
more than <i>you</i> do, right?

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:43.195
I do, but...

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:44.779
Still...

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:46.907
I'll be back in a bit.

00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:48.992
[footsteps departing]

00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:50.993
Sheesh.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.547
[inaudible dialogue]

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:08.970
[Tsumugi] Those boys from earlier
already dumped you, huh?

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.806
[Mio] Oh, Tsumugi, it's you.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.183
No, that's not what happened.

00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:15.346
[Tsumugi] Hiiragi won't leave
until we've helped you,

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.728
and that inconveniences me.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.980
Helped me, how? With what?

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.441
You're dating a guy
you hide your feelings from.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.735
It's real obvious
that you're not in love with him.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:26.655
If something's eating at you,
then you gotta spit it out.

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:28.615
Don't you feel sorry for him?

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:30.283
Are you talking about...

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:31.451
Oh!

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:32.744
No, you've got it wrong.

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:34.621
Ryuji's actually my big brother.

00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:35.704
Huh?

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:39.543
But... you are right about the other thing.

00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:43.255
I do wish I could express myself
a little more freely with him.

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:45.215

Mio! Oh, you're here with Tsumugi.

00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:55.392
Ryuji.

00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.313
Hiiragi told me
that he thought you and I needed to talk.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:03.024
The kid had gotten himself
pretty worked up about it.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:06.027
I guess he realized
that we've been acting awkward.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.656
You feel like we've... been acting awkward?

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:10.824
[sad music playing]

00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:13.702
I think that, since we were just kids,

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:17.164
I've known that when I turned around,
you'd be right behind me.

00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:21.710
I thought you'd follow my lead because
you like the same things as me, you know?

00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:25.130
I thought you liked
vintage clothes and flea markets.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:26.839
Yeah, I do.

00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:28.257
[Ryuji] Right.

00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:31.136
Part of me knew
that something else was off.

00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:34.264
But, for some reason,
I pretended not to notice.

00:24:34.764 --> 00:24:37.017
- [woman 1] Uh! Snow?!
- [man 1] Snow?!

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.934
[man 2] But how?

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.769
[woman 2] Uh, but it's summer!

00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:41.062
[woman 3] How strange!

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.690
Huh? Snow? Again?

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:47.068
[creature wails]

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.696
Oh, what's that?

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.448
The thing from before!

00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:53.450
Why is it here?

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.702

It's Mio and... Tsumugi. [gasps]

00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:05.545
[Ryuji] You know, sis...

00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:07.672
I've realized something.

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:11.968
The idea that family members
can understand each other without speaking

00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:13.094
is a big lie.

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:16.389
So, from now on, I'd like to hear more
of what <i>you</i> have to say.

00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:17.473
[gasps]

00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:21.853
Well, the truth is,
I have a whole lot of things I wanna say.

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.272
And so do I, Mom.

[Mio] You okay?

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.260
- She up and ran off!
- [Hiiragi] Thanks, Ryuji!

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:57.389
- She went that way!
- 'Kay. Thank you! For everything!

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.452
[gasps] Mm, thank goodness.
She's breathing at least.

00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:43.745
- [wind howling]
- Huh?

00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:11.391
HOJU NO YU KINOENE HOT SPRINGS INN

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.322
- [leaves rustling]
- Whoa!

00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:23.076
[Hiiragi groaning]

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.828
Uh... People?!

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:29.082
- [Hiiragi moaning]
- Hey, hey, hey! What happened to you?

00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:31.334
You two look like you just took a beating.

00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:34.212
She's in a bad way. Tsumugi...

00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:36.548
I'm begging you, please help her!

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.262
- [man] What's going on?
- She's hurt. Go get the first aid kit.

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:44.472
What happened?

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.392
[Tsumugi] I just... [moans]

00:28:47.475 --> 00:28:50.228
She was knocked out cold
when I found her by the riverbed.

00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:52.480
Seems like she took a bad fall.

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:56.067
Oh. Well, take her to room 206,
then, would you, dear?

00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:57.151
I'm on it.

00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.863
[man] Got that first aid kit right here!

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:06.619
[footsteps slowly approaching]

00:29:06.703 --> 00:29:07.787
[door opens]

00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:08.871
[grunting softly]

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.250
- It's morning.
- [Hiiragi] Uh... Good morning, ma'am.

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:13.834
[woman] Mm-hmm.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:22.761
Hmm.

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:26.222
Seems she isn't awake yet
because she's running a fever.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:28.641
Do help me get in touch with her parents.

00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:31.644
That's not... quite possible.

00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.271
It isn't? Why's that?

00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:35.106
Don't tell me she's a runaway.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.650
Listen, I need this room
available for customers.

00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:39.652
Help me reach her parents.

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.906
I'm sorry, ma'am. But I really can't.

00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:44.741
Can you at least explain why?

00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:46.658
No.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:51.915
But until she feels better,
I'm begging you to let us stay here.

00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:54.417
Yet you refuse to tell me why I should.

00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:57.921
I'm happy to earn our keep.
Until she wakes up, I'll work for you.

00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.923
Answer my questions first!

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:01.925
I'm a hard worker.

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:04.344
Please let us stay. You won't regret it.

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.389
[laughing]

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:09.849
[Hiiragi grunts] Um...

00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:11.726
You're certainly a stubborn one.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.062
And despite your youth,
you're eager to work.

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:17.148
Perhaps you would be able
to teach my husband a thing or two.

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:18.441
[upbeat music playing]

00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:19.859
[man] Have a good day!

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:34.958
Once you're done brushing in there,
fill up these shampoo bottles, 'kay?

00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:36.041
Sure.

00:30:37.126 --> 00:30:38.002
- Hiiragi!
- Huh?

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:40.255
- Be sure to vacuum up here too.
- Yes, ma'am!

00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.466
- Oh. Ah.
- And be careful!

00:30:45.051 --> 00:30:47.262
- [groans]
- You don't have to carry that much.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.430
- Just get what you can.
- Uh, sure.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.514
[man] Newbie!

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:53.434
Got you a fresh bucket.
I'll leave it here, 'kay?

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:54.978
Okay, thanks for grabbing it.

00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:56.354
[Tsumugi moans softly]

00:30:58.898 --> 00:31:01.317
[grunts, pants]

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.196
It was your idea
to work and earn your keep.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.240
So make sure you're able to keep at it.

00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:09.576
Uh... right!

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:12.537
[man 2] Good grief!
What age are you living in?

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.789
She means to say, "Don't work too hard."

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.917
- How about <i>you</i> get back to work?
- [man 2] Yikes.

00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.002
[music fades out]

[horn blares]

00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:30.364
Hey, wait!

00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:32.116
Wait for me!

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.749
[ethereal music playing]

00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:42.210
[Tsumugi grunting]

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:49.967
[echoes] Mom!

00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:55.223
[music fades out]

00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:58.142
[gasping] Oh.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:32:59.935
Oh.

00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:01.937
Huh?

00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:05.733
[weakly] That's right.
I've been at some kind of inn.

00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:07.819
- [door opens]
- Hm?

00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:11.197
Hiiragi.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.450
Oh, Tsumugi! You finally woke up.

00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:17.203
- You changed your clothes.
- [Hiiragi] How do you feel?

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.789
I've changed clothes too.

00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.332
Don't tell me <i>you</i> did this.

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:23.334
No! Of course not!

00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.419
It was the owner.

00:33:25.044 --> 00:33:27.588
Hm. Also, she told me to bring you this.

00:33:33.428 --> 00:33:35.054
- Mmm!
- [chuckles softly]

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:38.933
What <i>is</i> this thing? It tastes so yummy!

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:42.103
Yep. I've never had <i>onigiri</i>
like this before.

00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:46.357
So I'm glad you're feeling better now.

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.985
Has it been you
taking care of me this whole time?

00:33:49.068 --> 00:33:52.822
Uh-uh. The only thing I did was carry you
here when I found you passed out.

00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:54.991
We owe the people who run this inn a lot.

00:33:55.074 --> 00:33:58.077
They gave you medical treatment
and put us <i>both</i> up in this room.

00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:00.413
[Tsumugi chuckles softly]
They're really nice, huh?

00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:01.831
- Mm.
- [Tsumugi] Whoa!

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:04.459
This rolled omelet is crazy fluffy!

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.793
I can't believe it!

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.795
[Hiiragi] Ugh! Is that a bad thing?

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:10.464
[phone buzzes]

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.436
Thank you for the food, sir.

00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:26.814
- That <i>onigiri</i> was incredible.
- [man] Glad to hear it.

00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:30.193
So is Tsumugi feeling better now?

00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:33.905
- Yeah. And it's thanks to you.
- That's wonderful news.

00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:36.407
By the way, I've noticed that you smoke.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:38.826
Oh? You spotted me, did ya?

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:42.622
The old ball and chain
is always telling me to quit

00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:45.500
so I won't stink the place up
and bother our customers.

00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:48.419
My dad likes to go out and smoke too.

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:52.381
Have you found a chance
to talk to your parents lately?

00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:54.049
No.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.511
Well, I suppose that's the way it goes.

00:34:57.303 --> 00:35:00.807
Still, I'll say this, Hiiragi.
Sometimes, when people wait too long

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.518
to say what they need to,
they miss their chance.

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:05.103
So, once you're feeling up to it,

00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:07.647
you should let your parents know
that you're okay.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.732
[Tsumugi moaning gently]

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:14.654
[grunts softly]

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.328
[inhales, exhales deeply]

00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:37.301
Here you are. I laundered it
and stitched up the tears for you.

00:35:37.385 --> 00:35:38.386
[Tsumugi] You sure did.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.054
It's like brand-new!

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:41.973
Thank you.

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:44.225
It's that boy you should be thanking.

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:48.104
While you were recovering in here,
he worked very hard around the inn

00:35:48.187 --> 00:35:49.605
so that you two could stay.

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:50.857
[Tsumugi] Hm.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:52.524
Hey there, Mom.

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:57.738
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.

00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:00.199
Well, a lot happened.

00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:03.119
I'm staying at the Hoju no Yu inn
for the time being.

00:36:03.202 --> 00:36:05.329
What about Tsumugi? Is she there?

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:08.457
Okay. Well, that's good.

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.626
So when can we expect you to be back?

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.962
I've got something
that I have to see through.

00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:14.422
I'll come back after.

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.926
But I really am just fine, so don't worry.

00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:21.345
Yeah. See you.

00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:27.143
- [man grunts]
- [chuckles softly]

00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:30.104
[upbeat piano music playing]

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.442
We really appreciate your help.

00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:37.028
To be honest, it was no trouble.

00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:40.156
- Having you with us was quite fun.
- Mm.

00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:43.159
I think I'll miss this place.

00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:45.411
And I see you're still a kid.

00:36:45.494 --> 00:36:49.415
A little word of advice. You'll need
to be strong if you wanna protect Tsumugi.

00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:51.125
- Oh...
- [chuckles]

00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:56.172
Well, here at the inn,
we're used to saying goodbye. So, bye.

00:36:56.255 --> 00:36:57.256
Come back soon.

00:36:57.757 --> 00:37:00.426
- Right. And again, thanks so much...
- Thank you so much.

00:37:00.509 --> 00:37:01.928
...for everything you've done.

00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:03.262
[Tsumugi] See you later!

00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:06.682
[man] Come back
and visit us anytime you'd like!

00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:09.435
[upbeat music continues]

00:37:15.816 --> 00:37:18.194
How long will it be
till we reach Hie Shrine?

00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:21.197
I'm pretty sure
we should get there this evening.

00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:22.781
I see.

00:37:23.532 --> 00:37:24.617
So we're close now.

00:37:26.702 --> 00:37:28.454
- [grunts, gasps]
- [gasps]

00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:30.289
[both loudly gasp]

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.968
Wow! So cool!

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.844
I've never seen anything like this!

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.263
Me neither!

00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:47.932
TV doesn't do this place justice at all!

00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:49.895
[Tsumugi] Of course not!
Did you think it would?

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:52.019
[Hiiragi] Can you just let me
express my thoughts?

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.021
[Tsumugi] Fine! If I must!

00:37:58.526 --> 00:37:59.652
[music fades out]

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:03.698
[tires squeal]

00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:09.912
[concierge] Welcome, sir.

00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:13.249
Hey, you there! I've heard my son,
Hiiragi, has been staying here!

00:38:13.332 --> 00:38:15.459
[concierge] Hiiragi? Uh...
Then, are you Hiiragi's...

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:16.583
- I'm his father!
- [gasps]

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:17.854
- [door opens]
- [concierge] Huh?

00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:19.755
Welcome to our humble inn, sir.

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:22.049
Does an urgent matter require attention?

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:25.720
Yeah, you been keepin' my son here,
and I wanna see him this instant!

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.555
I'm afraid he's already left.

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:28.556
Where to?

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.308
Hurry up and tell me right now!

00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:32.977
What an impatient man you are.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.188
Do you think I have time to waste
on people who aren't customers?

00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:39.066
- What a rude thing to assume.
- Huh?

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.736
Let's both calm down
and take our time in the back.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.612
This way, sir.

00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:45.323
Uh... Huh?

00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:57.793
So what's the Hidden Village like, anyway?

00:38:57.877 --> 00:38:59.670
Mmm, let me think.

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:03.841
Well, first of all, it's super cold there.
I mean, it snows all year round.

00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:06.719
That's normal for us oni though.
We don't mind it a bit.

00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:08.428
I see.

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:12.433
Do you think
that you'll go back to the Hidden Village

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.893
once you've met your mom?

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.771
Yeah! I'll go back.

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:17.854
[Hiiragi] I see.

00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:19.981
[Tsumugi] Hm?

00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:27.323
[chuckles] What's the matter, Hiiragi?
[teasing] You scared you'll miss me?

00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:29.158
No! I was just kinda curious!

00:39:29.992 --> 00:39:32.078
[grunts] Not again!

00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:33.913
- Hey! [groans]
- [Tsumugi laughing]

00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:36.749
[Hiiragi] What is your mom like?

00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:38.876
Can't say I remember.

00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:41.670
I was just three years old
when she left me and my dad.

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:45.174
Are... you still planning to punch her
once you've tracked her down?

00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:50.304
Hmm. I definitely want to reserve
the right to punch her if she needs it.

00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:54.809
But, before that, I think I'll at least
give her a chance to explain why she left.

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.310
I mean, who knows?

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.562
Maybe she had
a surprisingly good reason to.

00:39:58.646 --> 00:39:59.646
Yeah.

00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:03.359
Honestly, I don't think
I'll know how to feel

00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:05.653
or what I'll want until I'm in the moment.

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:06.862
You're probably right.

00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:08.948
- [Tsumugi gasps]
- Hm?

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:10.616
[mystical jingling]

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:12.701
[gentle piano music playing]

00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:14.370
That looks like...

00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:19.291
- [grunts]
- Uh... Tsumugi?

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.586
[Tsumugi sighs] Hm?

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880
[Hiiragi sighs].

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:28.008
[footsteps approaching]

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.760
- [man] You two customers?
- [Tsumugi] Hm?

00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:32.221
[Hiiragi] Oh... Sorry to intrude.

00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:36.517
We were just looking at the art
on the folding screen you've got in there.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.145
But, uh... we don't have any money.

00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:43.524
- We should... get going.
- [Tsumugi] It's fine. We're just looking.

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:47.486
- [Hiiragi, quietly] Yeah, but it's a café.
- I've got no customers at the moment.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.448
So you can come in and take a closer look
if you're interested.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.118
- Wanna see another angle?
- Oh! Thank you very much, sir.

00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:55.201
Awesome!

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.372
[Tsumugi] I was once told

00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:02.042
that the reason the Hidden Village
was able to stay hidden

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.753
is because of our relationship
with the local gods,

00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:06.672
who cloaked the village in snow.

00:41:06.755 --> 00:41:08.382
We called them Snow Gods.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.218
Until pretty recently,
I thought they were a fairy tale.

00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:15.389
But maybe
it's a Snow God that attacked us.

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:19.101
Although... no one ever told me
they ate oni.

00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:20.561
[rattling]

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.189
Uh...

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:27.818
[man] I'm experimenting
with a new herbal tea blend.

00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:28.903
Try it, please.

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.405
I'd love to get your opinion
about how it tastes.

00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:34.616
[loud gulping]

00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:38.329
Ah! So good!

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:40.748
[Hiiragi] It really is delicious.

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:43.709
Been wanting to try out
these new tea leaves I bought.

00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:46.962
- This seemed like a good chance.
- So where do these tea leaves come from?

00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:49.715
I think these ones
were from the Czech Republic.

00:41:49.798 --> 00:41:51.967
But I get leaves
from Sweden and Egypt too.

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.679
I'm still able to get my hands on
<i>some</i> unique products,

00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:58.432
thanks to friends I made
when I traveled in my youth.

00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:00.309
Wow, cool!

00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:01.644
Did you travel alone?

00:42:02.144 --> 00:42:03.729
No. Went with my wife.

00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:06.524
She passed away about four years ago.

00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:07.607
[softly] Oh.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:11.487
You know,
I have some pictures of us over here.

00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.615
That's my wife standing right next to me.

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:17.493
She's wearing something
known as a Basotho hat.

00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:21.330
It's a traditional hat
from the country of Lesotho in Africa.

00:42:21.413 --> 00:42:24.291
It was designed to resemble
the shape of a mountain.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.920
- Wow! It's really interesting.
- [Tsumugi] Uh-huh.

00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:30.881
Ah, then you'll be pleased to know
that it's now on your head.

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:31.799
[Hiiragi] Uh.

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.843
- And this is a traditional Inuit hat.
- Uh!

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.180
I wore it
when we traveled to northern Canada

00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:41.350
so we could get a look at the Aurora.
Warmest hat I know of.

00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:44.603
Town we stayed in
drops to minus 40 degrees Celsius.

00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:46.730
[both] Minus 40 degrees Celsius?!

00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:47.814
[grunts]

00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:49.316
[laughs]

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.443
You two make quite a pair in those hats.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:52.903
[poignant music playing]

00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:55.322
[Hiiragi] So then, all the things here

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:57.616
hold memories
that you made with your wife.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.076
[Tsumugi] That's lovely.

00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:02.246
Oh, where did you get that folding screen?

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:04.123
[man] It was actually
one of the few things

00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:06.208
that came with the house
when we bought it.

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:09.962
I believe that it was made by a local,
but I don't know who the artist was

00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:12.464
or even how long ago
they might've painted it.

00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:14.967
Looks like it's telling a story, right?

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.594
I think it might be.

00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:18.429
And that story might even be true.

00:43:18.512 --> 00:43:20.472
Maybe Snow Gods... ate oni.

00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:21.390
[door opens]

00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:24.476
[woman] I told you to be careful,
didn't I? We're back!

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.812
Please try really hard
not to lose it again.

00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:29.982
{\an8}- [child grunts]
- I'm glad you're confident at least. Uh...

00:43:30.065 --> 00:43:31.525
Oh, customers?

00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:34.236
- [man] Welcome back.
- Nice to meet you.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.739
That's my daughter
and my grandson, Haruto.

00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:39.491
- [Tsumugi] Hello.
- [Hiiragi] Hi! Sorry to intrude.

00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:42.369
[woman] Go ahead, Haruto. Say hello.

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.580
Hello there! [babbles]

00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:45.748
So cute.

00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:48.709
'Kay, let's wash your hands
and get you some juice.

00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:50.418
Oh...

00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:52.771
- [Haruto] Your heads look weird!
- Huh?

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.006
[woman] Hey! Be nice!

00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:58.010
- I'm sorry, you two. Take your time!
- [Haruto laughing]

00:43:58.093 --> 00:43:59.345
[footsteps retreating]

00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:03.015
[man] This café is full of treasures
that remind me of my wife, yes.

00:44:03.098 --> 00:44:06.602
But I treasure those two
more than anything in this world.

00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:09.271
I guess I feel as though
I'm passing down my legacy.

00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:11.982
My love for them
is like a force of nature.

00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:15.527
Oh jeez! I'm real sappy these days.

00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:18.030
Guess it's just a hazard of getting older.

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:21.867
[Tsumugi sighs] It's raining.

00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:26.622
And we're still a fair distance
from the shrine. Okay with getting wet?

00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:28.624
<i>Or</i> just take this with you.

00:44:29.249 --> 00:44:32.544
Oh. We couldn't possibly.
You've been so nice to us already. Uh...

00:44:33.128 --> 00:44:34.963
There's no need to bring it back.

00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:37.549
But next time you're in the neighborhood,
come buy some tea.

00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:39.802
- [Haruto] Hey!
- Hey! Slow it down!

00:44:40.427 --> 00:44:41.804
Bye-bye!

00:44:41.887 --> 00:44:43.389
Bye-bye!

00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:45.557
[moving music playing]

00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:53.482
Hey. About the art on that folding screen...

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.819
[Tsumugi] Mm. I think
those <i>were</i> Snow Gods.

00:44:57.403 --> 00:44:59.613
But since they were attacking oni,

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:02.074
I wonder if the village is okay?

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:04.534
[Hiiragi] Hm.

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:11.542
Before we found the café,
you asked me if I was planning

00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:15.587
on going back to the Hidden Village
once I'm able to find my mom, right?

00:45:16.338 --> 00:45:19.049
- Yeah.
- I think I'll <i>need</i> to go home.

00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:21.343
I can't just leave my dad all by himself.

00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:23.136
But someday...

00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:24.930
Hey. Wait up!

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.100
I wanna see as much of the world as I can!

00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:30.686
Lesotho's supposed to be
really hot, right?

00:45:30.769 --> 00:45:32.104
Wonder if it snows there?

00:45:32.187 --> 00:45:36.358
Before today, I had no idea there was
a town colder than the Hidden Village.

00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:40.863
There must be so many kinds of people.
So many ways of seeing things!

00:45:40.946 --> 00:45:45.117
I only came out here to find my mom,
but I've gotten to learn so much!

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.619
Oh, and meeting you was all right too!

00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:50.247
Huh? Did you really
have to phrase it like that?

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.331
[Tsumugi laughs]

00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:54.710
So, what about you? What do you wanna do?

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.881
Uh... honestly,
I haven't given it much thought.

00:45:58.964 --> 00:46:02.134
It can be anything!
Just say whatever you're feeling!

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:04.678
Well, I guess... at the moment,

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:07.514
I really just wanna make sure
that I do my best for you.

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:10.267
- [grunts] Is that bad?
- [Tsumugi chuckles softly]

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.853
You won't hear me complaining!

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:16.106
[both panting]

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.784
Hiiragi. I just thought of
one more thing I'd really like to do.

00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:30.370
The thing is, there's no way
that I can make it happen without you.

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.289
So you'll promise to help me, right?

00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:36.043
Oh... I can't promise
till I know what you want though.

00:46:36.835 --> 00:46:37.753
That's odd.

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:41.548
I could've sworn I just heard you say
you wanted to do your best for me.

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:42.925
I did, but...

00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:45.052
[grunts] Okay, fine, then.

00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.557
[gulps, sighs softly]

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:52.518
When we finish this journey,

00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.812
you need to have
a serious talk with your dad.

00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:58.065
[groans] Where the heck
is <i>this</i> coming from?

00:46:58.857 --> 00:47:00.943
This good-luck charm will help you do it.

00:47:01.026 --> 00:47:02.069
CHILDBIRTH CHARM

00:47:02.694 --> 00:47:05.072
- But it's...
- Don't worry!

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:06.865
It's extremely effective.

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:11.411
- After all, it did bring me this far.
<i>- That</i> isn't what I meant.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.747
- [Tsumugi] Give it back when you're done.
- [scoffs]

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.833
I wonder when that'll be.

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.335
Uh... Snow!

00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:20.712

00:47:20.796 --> 00:47:22.965

Duck! Oh!

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.531
Sorry, Hiiragi!

00:47:53.495 --> 00:47:54.495
Over here!

<i>Please stand clear of the doors

Grab my hand!

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:25.902
Tsumugi!

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.614
- [door chiming]
- Come on! [grunts]

[music fades out]

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.680
We're nearly at the shrine.

00:48:54.389 --> 00:48:55.891
Huh? Oh.

00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:09.487
[moans softly]

Hm.

[gasps]

00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:02.791

[wind howling]

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.553
How... Wait, Tsumugi?

00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:16.471
Huh? It's my dad!

00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:17.556
[gulps]

00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:19.534
- [rapid footsteps]
- Mm... Uh... The... Sorry...

00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:20.892
[Dad] I finally found you!

00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.854
Hang on. What is this?

00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:26.440
[grunts] What are you doing here, Dad?
Where's Mom?

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:27.899
Where is she?!

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.194
You won't find her here.

00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:32.529
Why not?!

00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:35.073
This is the place
that you told me she ran off to!

00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:36.783
I'm sorry, Tsumugi.

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:39.995
It never occurred to me back then that
you would decide to come all this way.

00:50:40.078 --> 00:50:41.872
I don't care what you thought!

00:50:41.955 --> 00:50:44.249
Just tell me the truth
about where she is now!

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.750
I'd like to.

00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:47.502
But I cannot.

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.337
Why are you hiding it?!

00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:52.215
If there's a reason I can't meet her,
I deserve to know!

00:50:52.841 --> 00:50:53.841
Or did...

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.638
Did Mom say... to keep me away
because she doesn't wanna see me?

00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.806
It's not that!

00:51:00.348 --> 00:51:01.391
[Tsumugi] I see.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.189
Then... is she already dead?

00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:08.523
[Dad] She's alive!

00:51:08.607 --> 00:51:10.817
She's just out of reach.

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:11.901
And...

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.655
Never mind that. There's been trouble
at the Hidden Village.

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.842
- The Snow Gods have been acting...
- "Never mind that"?!

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:20.535
She is my mother!
How could I ever not mind?

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.998
Why are y... you so...

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.834
[moans softly] I've had enough!

00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:30.879
[Hiiragi] Tsumugi! Uh...

00:51:30.962 --> 00:51:32.130
[Dad sighs]

Hey, um, you should know...

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.182
She might be angry, but she's also been
worried about you this whole time.

00:51:43.183 --> 00:51:44.643
As soon as she found her mom,

00:51:45.477 --> 00:51:48.814
she was planning to go back
to the Hidden Village to live with you.

00:51:49.481 --> 00:51:50.481
Who are <i>you?</i>

00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:52.734
Hiiragi Yatsuse.

00:51:53.568 --> 00:51:55.278
I'm Tsumugi's friend.

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:56.363
Excuse me.

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.204
[exhales]

00:52:17.342 --> 00:52:18.343
Tsumugi?

00:52:19.344 --> 00:52:22.097
- [Tsumugi] Leave me alone.
- I can't.

00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:26.601
Sorry. I really wanna be
by myself right now.

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.937
We should go back.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.857
It seems like...
Your dad must be worried sick.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.108
You think so?

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.487
Maybe if I worry him more,
he'll tell me the truth about my mom.

00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:41.283
He must be thinking
it's something he has to protect you from.

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:44.995
Or maybe there's something
he's not able to say.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.872
That makes no sense.

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:49.708
You know that
he's not doing it to hurt you.

00:52:51.042 --> 00:52:51.877
Don't you?

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.631
Oh. So you two think the truth'll hurt me
more than the years of getting lied to?

00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:59.301
N... no. That's not what I was saying.

00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:04.556
I know he wants to protect me.

00:53:05.473 --> 00:53:09.186
Ever since I was a kid,
I've been thinking about this every day.

00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:13.356
How could it ever be in my interest to
not know why I don't get to have a mom?

00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:15.901
It "seems like" he cares, huh?!

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:18.320
{\an8}Why would I care
what things "seem like" to you?

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.949
'Cause <i>I</i> care.
I'm thinking about what's best for <i>you</i>!

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.284
That right there!

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.286
You sound exactly like your dumb dad!

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.330
I'm not asking you to think for me!

00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:32.000
- You just wanna feel like you care!
- What about you?

00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:33.960
When will <i>you</i> stop playing the victim

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.463
and think about
someone else's feelings for once?

- [quickly] I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:52.771
Look, I'm grateful that
you helped me get to the shrine.

00:53:52.854 --> 00:53:55.065
But you should back off and move on.

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.570
[sighs] It's all wrong.

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:05.575
That wasn't what I... wanted to tell her.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160
I...

'Cause <i>I</i> care!
I'm thinking about what's best for <i>you</i>!

00:57:54.888 --> 00:57:55.972
Tsumugi!

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.058
I'm glad you're feeling better.

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:01.144
[gentle piano music playing]

00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:04.939
[Tsumugi] Dad, I'm sorry.

00:58:05.523 --> 00:58:07.567
- [gasps]
- [Tsumugi] But I...

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:10.653
I have to go apologize to him.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:14.073
[gasps] Tsumugi!

00:58:14.949 --> 00:58:16.075
Hey! Hold on!

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.119
[shouting] Explain yourselves, will ya?

00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:31.132
[breathing shakily]

00:58:31.799 --> 00:58:32.884
Thank you so much!

00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:38.389
We'll never forget
the sacrifice you've made for us!

00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:40.642
Our future is in your hands.

00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:44.687
{\an8}I have no doubt
that you're going to make us all proud.

00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:13.925
[wailing]

00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:19.847
[man] <i>The Snow Gods
are blessing us once more!</i>

00:59:19.931 --> 00:59:21.683
[woman 1] <i>Don't leave me alone!</i>

00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:23.685
[woman 2] <i>Now we can all
live in peace again.</i>

00:59:23.768 --> 00:59:24.852
[woman 1] <i>I need you.</i>

00:59:26.771 --> 00:59:28.189
- Tsumugi.
- [woman 1] <i>Tsumugi.</i>

00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:32.527
[music fades out]

00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:36.281
[wailing]

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.975
[man] There's a Snow God here!

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.228
- You get that gate closed!
- [man] Let's move!

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:10.481
[Hiiragi moaning softly]

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.450
[woman panting]

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.871
[woman groaning]

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.205
Are you okay?

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.625
[groans] Oh... [gasps softly]

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.585
Tsumugi...

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.130
Tsumugi? Who <i>are</i> you,
and how do you know her?

01:00:34.922 --> 01:00:36.716
I'm so sorry.

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:38.885
[sighs]

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.887
[man] Hey! Is that kid all right?

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.514
Looked to me
like he came out of a Snow God.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:47.143
He's still alive at least.
We need to get him to the tower.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.771
[both panting]

01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:50.854
[horn beeping]

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.359
[Hiiragi's dad] Get in!

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:57.695
You know where my son is, so help me!

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:00.948
[door mechanism beeps]

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:05.912
[door mechanism beeps]

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.123
- Let's go.
- Thank you!

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.003
Tsumugi, what you told me.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.047
- You sure it's true?
- Mm.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:18.591
I saw a picture in this world.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.551
In that picture, I saw the Snow Gods.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.304
The eaten oni weren't dead.
Just moved somewhere else.

01:01:24.138 --> 01:01:25.807
{\an8}So maybe we could still save him.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.935
- [Snow God wails]
- [woman screams]

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.187
More civilians? Go on ahead!

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.273
- [Snow God wails]
- Homare!

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:35.858
[woman screams]

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:36.943
[gasps] No!

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:39.696
[Snow God squeals]

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.239
[man 1 yells with effort]

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.365
[man 2] Isami!

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:46.035
[mother and baby sobbing]

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:47.578
We have to go!

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.205
- But he...
- Get moving.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.792
[both panting]

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:55.336
Are you awake now?

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.339
- [Hiiragi groans]
- Good. Then run. Hurry up!

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:01.676
[mystical music playing]

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:15.481
[gasping]

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:17.900
[music intensifies]

01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:19.484
[man 1] This way!

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.278
Come on.

01:02:26.617 --> 01:02:28.494
[man 2] Hey! You all right?

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:35.042
[quietly] There's no way we can bring him
back to the Hidden Village.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.126
Mm.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:38.421
I'm so sorry, but I need the toilet!

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:41.466
- Huh? Right now?
- I don't think I can hold it!

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:44.927
[door mechanism beeps]

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.721
[Tsumugi] Gotta be quick!

01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:49.599
- Good grief.
- [door mechanism beeps]

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:51.058
- Hm?
- [footsteps retreating]

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:52.852
Uh? Hey!

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.730
- Wait a sec, will y...
- [crunch]

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:56.689
Hell.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.566
- The heck?
- [car horn blaring]

01:02:58.649 --> 01:02:59.984
- [grunting]
- [rattling]

01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:01.486
[car horns blaring]

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.488
[Hiiragi's dad] What's goin' on here?!

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.495
[footsteps approaching]

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:14.539
Sorry for the wait.

01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:18.127
- You're truly determined to go back?
- Yeah, of course I am.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.212
Then wear this.

01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:22.088
Let's go.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.134
[chuckles softly]

01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:31.575
- [man 1] Faster!
- [man 2] Let's go!

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.035
- [man 3] Hurry up!
- [man 4] What's wrong?

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:34.661
- [man 5] I'm there now!
- [man 6] Got it!

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:35.895
[shouting continues]

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.064
[woman 1] First,
I'll have you meet Chief Gozen.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.192
Do your best to be polite, okay?

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:45.613
[man 7] Great. Carry it all in.
Grab whoever you need.

01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:46.864
[man 8] It's heavy.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:48.907
Ready, and...

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.411
We can't slow down yet.
Let's give it one more push, people!

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.495
- Right!
- Right!

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:54.872
[indistinct shouting]

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:56.791
- [woman 1] We're here.
- Oh.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:01.587
[Gozen] We'll still have as much medicine
here as I think we're likely to need.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.340
Don't wait
for the medical squad to arrive.

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:05.842
Go straight to the site.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:09.971
Your first priority
should be to get that medicine delivered.

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:13.224
You won't be going by yourself.
I'll assign you some guards.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.854
But still,
you should exercise every caution.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:19.063
Good luck out there.

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.730
[woman 2] Ma'am!

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.402
I'll be back soon.

01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:27.487
Follow me.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.658
[Gozen] Oh, wow! [laughing]

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.203
Hey, Toko,
take a look at the size of this bubble.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:37.874
A remarkable achievement, chief.
You may have set a new world record.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:41.002
I bet I have, and now it almost feels like
a waste to eat the thing.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:42.253
[woman 1] Reporting in.

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.965
A few minutes ago, a Snow God
entered the village from the sky, and...

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.926
[Gozen] And popped this boy out
onto a snowbank. I know!

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.177
Uh, right.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.138
But the boy's a new face here.

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.639
And his horn seems new.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.683
Has he only just become an oni?

01:04:55.766 --> 01:04:56.766
Huh?

01:04:57.643 --> 01:04:58.978
[grunts, gasps]

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.187
A horn?

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.107
Hm! The town has an entrance,

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.776
but falling from the sky
does turn more heads.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.195
Tell me, how did you make it
out of the Snow God?

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:09.447
Uh...

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:13.492
[Gozen] The youngsters that brought you
here saw you burst out of a Snow God

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.702
as it disappeared.

01:05:15.369 --> 01:05:17.997
So how did you get out?
What do you remember?

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:19.539
Well, uh...

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:22.043
I remember the Snow God eating me.

01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:24.211
Then it got really cold.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.214
And I think I might've heard some voices?

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.967
But I... I can't be sure.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.054
This Snow God business.

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:35.806
People used to claim
the Snow Gods were our guardians.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.309
Ones who keep
the Hidden Village shrouded in snow

01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:40.478
and invisible to prying human eyes.

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:42.855
But just look at what's happening now.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.483
The Snow Gods have started attacking us.

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:51.989
Mmm. Delicious!

01:05:56.661 --> 01:06:01.123
There isn't much I can tell you.
Let's start by talking to Gozen.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.679
[metal clanking]

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:17.223
- Strange. [grunting]
- [Tsumugi] What's wrong?

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.934
- [Dad] This turnstile's jammed.
- [clanking continues]

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:22.687
- Oh... Dad!
- [man] Izuru!

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:26.065
Under martial law, it's a crime to leave.
You should know that.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.567
We're in a hurry,
so help me get out of this thing!

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.697
Sure, I'll get you out.
But you're spending the night in custody.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.408
{\an8}- [quietly] Tsumugi, go on without me.
- You sure?

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:38.160
It's fine. I'll figure out
a way to catch up with you.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.244
Now go!

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:42.123
[man] Huh? Oh... Hey!

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:43.457
Get back here!

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.751
[Tsumugi gasps]

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.586
[both grunting]

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.213
- Go after her!
- Uh, yeah.

01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:51.132
[mystical music playing]

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:00.224
[breathing heavily]

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:01.934
[weakly] Where'd she run off to?

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:11.610
[breathing shakily]

01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:19.410
[yelping]

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:44.184
[music ends]

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.150
So, uh...

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.653
Have you remembered something new?

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.406
When I was inside of that Snow God,

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.784
it felt like
I was having this strange dream.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:01.451
I saw a mask.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.579
And I heard bells.

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:06.182
- Snow Gods were flying around me.
- [gasps] What? It's Hiiragi.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.335
[Hiiragi] And a girl
was looking at the snow.

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:14.381
Then... I heard a woman say,
"Don't leave me alone."

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:17.343
- Then she said, "Tsumugi."
- [Tsumugi gasps]

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:21.514
[Hiiragi] Then again,
maybe <i>I</i> was the one calling to Tsumugi?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.641
I'm not sure.

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:26.936
- [Gozen] Perhaps this is our punishment.
- Uh?

01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:31.982
In the deepest recesses
of the Hidden Village,

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:35.069
there's a place called Oni Island,
which is home to a shrine,

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:37.029
wherein there sits the Spirit Mask

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.949
that we've long used
to summon the Snow Gods.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.201
The Spirit Mask has powers?

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:43.119
That's right.

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:46.330
It's what makes the Snow Gods
keep our home hidden from humans.

01:08:47.373 --> 01:08:48.373
[slurps]

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.126
I'm confused.

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:52.711
Why's it so important
the village stay hidden?

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:56.715
[Gozen] You might understand a bit,
now that you've become an oni.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:00.928
No matter what country you go to
or what era you find yourself in,

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.473
there will be those who can only live
by suppressing their feelings.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:08.978
These people need a place where
they're safe and free to be themselves.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:13.899
That's what this place is.
And that's why I must protect it.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.985
- [Tsumugi] Hmm!
- [footsteps approaching]

01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:17.945
So, if we destroy this mask,

01:09:18.028 --> 01:09:20.906
then the Snow Gods will leave us alone.
Is that right?

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.659
Didn't realize you were back... Tsumugi.

01:09:25.619 --> 01:09:26.745
Hi, Hiiragi.

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.706
You were tough to find.

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:29.789
Tsumugi!

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.750
If you break the mask,

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.253
then our Hidden Village
will be hidden no longer.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.006
And what will happen
if everyone gets eaten?

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:39.592
I don't see much point
in a village without people.

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:42.677
Oh, Hiiragi.

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:45.472
You turned into an oni.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:47.600
[Hiiragi shakily] Yeah.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.730
I bet you must be hungry.

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:54.273
Let's grab a bite together.

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:58.861
Chief Gozen, can we raid the food pantry?
I'm super hungry.

01:09:58.944 --> 01:10:00.738
Sure, knock yourselves out.

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:02.448
- Let's go. Hiiragi.
- [Hiiragi] Okay.

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:06.035
Tsumugi. You're not...
going to go <i>there,</i> are you?

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.125
Hey, Toko?

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.296
Look after those kids for me, would you?

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.089
They worry me.

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:20.173
[Toko] Understood.

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:23.135
[indistinct background chatter]

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.554
Hiiragi... I'm so sorry.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:28.933
I, uh, said some awful things
back at the park.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.392
Same here.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:34.188
Sorry. I shouldn't have tried
to push my feelings onto you like that.

01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:36.065
[rattling]

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:38.025
[woman] Excuse me, dears.

01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:41.111
[both chuckle softly]

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:43.739
[man in distance] It seems secure!

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:47.868
[man] <i>This is no time to act out.</i>

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:50.079
I can't believe you.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:10:59.880
[men grunt]

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.385
[grunting]

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:08.389
{\an8}[man] You stupid... Wait!
What are you... [groaning]

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:09.848
{\an8}[yelling]

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.850
{\an8}- [loud thud]
- [man groaning]

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.434
Sorry.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.145
[man] Wait! Izuru!

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:16.605
[child] Get ready! Catch!

01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:20.150
[Hiiragi] You're planning
to go to Oni Island, aren't you?

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.653
Oh, uh... I wasn't planning on it.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:24.905
We'll go together.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.700
No, we won't.
You need to stay here where it's safe.

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:30.244
I just wanna be wherever <i>you</i> are.

01:11:30.327 --> 01:11:31.954
Well, even so...

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.714
Well, this is the food pantry.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.466
There should be lots of stuff in here
that's ready to eat.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.431
- [Hiiragi gasps]
- Cool, right?

01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:53.183
- Grab whatever you want. Go ahead.
- [chuckles]

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.771
[Hiiragi] This is amazing.
There's so much in here.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.065
- [door squeaks, bangs]
- Huh?

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.026
- Tsumugi?
- [metallic jangle]

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:03.444
I... is something wrong?

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.153
Oh...

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.866
[grunts] Tsumugi!

01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:11.076
[gentle piano music playing]

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.078
Open the door! Please! Tsumugi!

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.331
- Tsumugi!
- [banging at door]

01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:19.001
I'm sorry, but there's no way
I could take you.

01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:21.420
You still have a chance
of returning back home.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.214
- [Hiiragi] What are you talking about?
- So just stay right here.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.009
- [Hiiragi] I wanna stay with you!
- Hiiragi...

01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:28.093
[Hiiragi] Why are you...

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:31.430
{\an8}[sighs softly] I'm so glad
I got to meet you, Hiiragi.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.848
{\an8}[footsteps approaching]

01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:33.931
[gasps]

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:39.897
[banging at door]

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:44.860
[Hiiragi, sadly] Tsumugi.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.121
- [distant bang]
- Oh!

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:58.665
[grunts] Help me!

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:01.502
If you can hear me, please open the door!

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:03.587
- Is anyone out there?
- [banging at door]

01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:08.550
- [Hiiragi] Let me out of here, please!
- [banging continues]

01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:11.136
Who's that yelling in there?

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.721
My name is Hiiragi!

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.641
Sorry, but... would you please let me out?

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.185
[gasps] Oh, wait, it's Hiiragi.

01:13:18.268 --> 01:13:19.645
I'm glad you're not dead.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:22.147
[quietly] Uh? Is that Tsumugi's dad?

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.191
[Izuru] Why are you in there?

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.403
[Hiiragi] 'Cause of Tsumugi.
She locked me in.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:29.738
[child] Whoa! [laughing]

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.582
{\an8}[Izuru distantly]
Do you know where she went?

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:33.335
{\an8}- [child] Huh?
- [Hiiragi] She's planning...

01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:35.744
I'll say once you let me out.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:38.414
Hey, sis, I can hear people
talkin' through the walls.

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:41.267
[Izuru] The only reason Tsumugi
came back here was to try and save you.

01:13:41.291 --> 01:13:44.711
If she's locked you in here, that means
she doesn't want to involve you in this...

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:49.425
[through speakers] <i>...any more than she has.
You should think about how Tsumugi feels.</i>

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.426
[Hiiragi] <i>I know.</i>

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:55.889
<i>I want to value Tsumugi's feelings. I do.</i>

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:56.973
<i>But...</i>

01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:00.394
<i>I've realized that
my feelings have value too!</i>

01:14:01.478 --> 01:14:05.399
<i>My whole life, I've always gone
with what the people around me wanted.</i>

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:09.653
<i>It became second nature.
I stopped questioning it.</i>

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.157
But then I met Tsumugi
and traveled with her.

01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:16.952
{\an8}It's thanks to her that I've learned
how important it is

01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:18.912
{\an8}to trust in your own feelings.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.665
{\an8}Hm! I wanna help Tsumugi see this through!

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:24.001
And not because I was told to!

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.171
<i>I might not be of much use to her.</i>

01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:28.839
<i>I might even die.</i>

01:14:29.506 --> 01:14:32.926
<i>But still... I want to be with Tsumugi!</i>

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:36.513
{\an8}So, please, sir,
open the door and let me do this!

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:40.350
[metallic clank]

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.522
Hiiragi, let's do this.

[music ends]

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:50.694
Huh? Why...

01:14:51.945 --> 01:14:53.447
- [woman 1 sighs]
- [man 1] Oh.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:54.615
- Wear this.
- [Hiiragi] Oh.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.993
- I'll guide you to the island.
- Yeah? Thanks so much. I owe you.

01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:00.454
- [woman 2] Wear this too.
- I appreciate it.

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:03.457
- Good luck out there, okay? Be safe!
- Try not to die!

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.834
- [woman 2] Do take care.
- [man 2] All the best.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.503
- Hm.
- Hm.

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:09.713
Everyone, thanks for your support!

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:12.965
Hm.

- Sorry for the wait. Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

- [Hiiragi] Thank you.
- I wondered about this myself.

Izuru, hop on behind me.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.735
- You ride with her, Hiiragi.
- 'Kay!

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:34.780
Thanks again, ma'am.

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:37.783
- Did you track down Tsumugi?
- Uh... yes.

01:15:38.408 --> 01:15:40.869
- But she kinda ended up ditching me.
- [scoffs]

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.330
I see. Well, some of us like to be chased.

01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:45.499

- [Hiiragi] Izuru!
- You'll have to go on without us, Hiiragi!

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:25.242
Follow the wind tunnel,
and you'll reach Oni Island!

But I...

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:29.621
I trust you to find Tsumugi!

01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:26.666
Hiiragi, wait!

01:32:26.749 --> 01:32:28.834
Say hi to your sister for me!

01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:31.254
Hiiraaagiiiii!

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.340
- [man 1] Hurry up!
- [man 2] I am!

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.510
Hm.

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:44.475
I suppose the Hidden Village
will just have to adapt.

[Dad] Hm?

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:02.785
[gasps] Hiiragi!

01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:05.746
It's you!
Where have you been this whole time?

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.748
You're not hurt, are you?
I've been so worried.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.835
- Where are those two...
- Listen, Dad. I'm sorry I worried you.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.047
I've got a lot of things
I'd like to tell you.

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:17.633
- Let's go home.
- Mm.

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:42.217
Hm.

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:55.940
- [horn blares]
- Hm?

01:34:59.902 --> 01:35:01.529
Bus is now departing.

[doors hiss shut]

01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:07.535
[Tsumugi] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! I'm getting off!

01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:15.710
Wha... Tsumugi?

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:17.544
Tsumugi!

01:35:18.295 --> 01:35:21.215
Oh! Hi, Hiiragi. Just where have you been?

01:35:21.298 --> 01:35:23.050
[groaning] Uh... huh?

01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:26.220
Care to explain why you never visited?

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:29.515
Wha... I tried! But every time
I walked through the entrance,

01:35:29.598 --> 01:35:32.101
it just... led me to some other place.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:36.522
- Oh... right! Only oni can get through it.
- Ah.

01:35:37.356 --> 01:35:38.607
[Tsumugi] By the way,

01:35:39.191 --> 01:35:41.485
were you able
to talk things out with your dad?

01:35:42.361 --> 01:35:45.531
Mm. It's honestly
still a work in progress.

01:35:45.614 --> 01:35:46.615
But we're okay now.

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:49.493
One more thing. This is yours.

01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:51.661
[Tsumugi] Thanks.

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.460
So, Hiiragi. Speaking of

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:01.255
communicating feelings,
I came to share mine.

01:36:02.339 --> 01:36:03.340
Uh?

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.801
[Hiiragi] Uh, wait! You mean...

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:07.970
- Let me go first!
- [Tsumugi] No, no, no, no, no!

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:10.973
It's my turn, for sure. Right?

01:36:12.349 --> 01:36:15.019
