[footsteps approaching]

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.890
[over PA] đây là vé của bạn
và bạn đang đến ga tàu staff.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.310
và vui lòng bước lên một bước
khi disembarking.

Huh?

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.270
[thở]

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.900
[over PA] đây là ga tàu Yonezawa .

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.530
Disembark đây là nơi chuyển đổi

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.280
đến đường Yonezawa
hoặc đến tàu  Yamagata Bullet .

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.860
làm ơn làm như vậy...

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.780
- xin lỗi.
- vâng?

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.870
Về cái này...

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.410
[chơi một bản nhạc cổ điên]

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500

[gasping softly]

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.530
Hey!

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.860
- Mashima...
- [tràn trai] Mashima!

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.240
Yo, buổi sáng thế nào?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.790
[boy] không tệ.
mày thấy thế nào?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.450
Nah, trường của tao bị khóa bên ngoài
của bốn cái tên này.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.500
Nhóm của tao là takin' nó rất dễ .

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.920
Well you could always
watch us practice. Huh?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.960
[Mashima] I'd just
make you feel self-conscious.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.350
[hopeful music playing]

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640
Hmm?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.230
[gasps]

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.320
Snowing?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.030
MY ONI GIRL

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.920
Did you see the snow? It started falling
right before I got here this morning.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.840
I saw it too!
Guess it's what you call a "freak storm."

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.090
I forgot all about that!
I mean, I did my homework, but I...

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.430
- I went ahead and ate all of it.
- Oh really?

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.080
- You gotta tell me how it tasted.
- It didn't taste like anything...

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.600
- I'm tellin' you, it's true, man!
- Hey, no judgement.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.940
I passed out when mine was just half done.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.440
Oh. Hey, Hiiragi.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.570
Morning. Wanna look
at my homework for today?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.440
- Here.
- For real? Let me see!

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.780
- I'll copy it real quick. Wait here!
- I'm gonna do the same thing!

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.160
As they run, she asks
if the dew on the grass is a pearl.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.450
The man doesn't answer.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.410
But when she's gone, he comes to wish
that, like the dew, he could disappear.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.920
Cool! Now, I'd like each of you
to pair up with one of your neighbors.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.250
You're gonna draw each other's portraits.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.670
[pupils chatter excitedly]

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.680
I'm havin' a good-hair day,
so you draw me first!

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.430
- Wanna be partners?
- Yeah, of course.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.180
- Yatsuse! Looks like you get to draw me.
- Uh... great.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.850
[sports whistle blows]

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.430
[coach] Gym monitors,
sweep the floor, please!

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.980
Hey! I'll help out too!

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.020
Uh, seriously? We actually need
to be somewhere right after this.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.530
- You mind takin' over?
- [Hiiragi] Uh, s... sure.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.070
Thanks so much!
Let's get outta here! [laughs]

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.570
We appreciate you! [laughs]

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.620
But I... Uh.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.160
[panting]

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.000
[girl] Yatsuse!

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.750
Come over here.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.170
I'll be so grateful!

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.670
No way! I can't do it!
They'll find us out for sure.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.760
I know this is awkward,
but there's no one else I can turn to.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840
'Kay?

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.890
[exhales shakily, groans]

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.100
[music playing indistinctly]

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.770
[girl] Ready for this, Yatsuse?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.640
Try to stick to the story
we just went over.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.060
It's fine to ad-lib,
but only as a last resort!

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.610
Well, here goes.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.150
Put a smile on!

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.400
[loud indistinct chatter]

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.780
- Look, they made it. Hey, Ai!
- Long time no see!

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.320
[Ai] Did we keep you waiting?

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.990
[girl 1] Nah, we just got here.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.580
[girl 2] So. This must be...

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.450
Yup! My boyfriend, Yatsuse.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.120
I said I'd bring him, so I did.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.580
Nice to meet you all.
My name's Hiiragi Yatsuse.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.540
[girls squeal]

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.710
This is amazing!

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.630
When you first said
you'd bring your boyfriend,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.270
I didn't think you were telling the truth.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.100
[girl 3] To be honest, I kinda thought
you'd let a lie get out of hand.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.340
[girl 2] Is he a first year too?
Did you meet in class?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.660
- [Ai] We're in different classes.
- [girl 1] Who made the first move?

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.780
- Spill it.
- [Ai] Well, uh...

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.560
Well, they know we're not dating.
I mean, how could they not?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.440
I guess I asked too much of you.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.940
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.820
I shouldn't have asked you
to do something so weird.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.280
Especially if I'm right that
you never had a real girlfriend before?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.700
- Hm...
- I see.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.280
Well, if you find someone,
try to take good care of her.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.780
Anyway, thanks.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.160
Mm.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.410
[sighs]

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.040
[emotional music playing]

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.630
[man] We really do need to get moving.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.130
Hold on a sec. I've got it here somewhere.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.970
I have a busload of passengers
waiting on you.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.720
- Where could it be?
- [Hiiragi] Uh...

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.470
Does she need help?

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.020
[grunting softly]

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.520
- [girl sighs]
- [footsteps approaching]

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.210
[driver] Miss, we're on a schedule here.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.650
- [Hiiragi] Scuse me?
- [girl] Uh?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.410
I don't mind covering her bus fare.
I... if that's okay?

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.450
What is this? Are you with her?

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.910
[Hiiragi] Yeah, I am.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.660
- [girl] Nu-uh!
- Okay. Perfect.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.660
It's fine. I can just walk.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.710
[Hiiragi grunts]

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.710
- You can go ahead and leave.
- Yeah? Sorry, then.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.670
We're now departing!

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.300
[groans]

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.510
Hey, why'd you step in and try to help me?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.270
Uh... well... you looked like you needed help.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.810
- I was doing just fine on my own.
- Ah.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.440
Mm, course you were.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.150
- I guess I just felt like being nosy.
- [bubbling]

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.940
[gasps]

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.450
Anyway, I'd better head on home now.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.280
Be careful on your walk!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.950
- [girl] Oh!
- Hm?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.410
I just remembered!

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.500
- I actually do need someone's help.
- Hm?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.210
[Hiiragi] So... what's your name?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.300
- Tsumugi. What's yours?
- Hiiragi.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.340
This is our place.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.430
[Tsumugi] This house is huge!

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.970
It's not weird
that I accepted your invite, is it?

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.270
What? You definitely invited yourself.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.560
- Oh. That how it seemed?
- Uh-uh-uh... It... it doesn't matter.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.730
[Tsumugi] Aw! It's eating it! [chuckles]

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.530
I'm glad you dropped in
before I started making dinner.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.490
- You're makin' us croquettes, right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.870
When your son brings his girlfriend home,
you pull out all the stops.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.740
[Tsumugi] Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.040
- [Mom] What? You aren't?
- [girl] I see.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.870
[Mom] Well you should stay
for dinner anyway, all right?

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.000
- [door shuts]
- [man] I'm home.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.170
- [Mom] Welcome back!
- [girl] Welcome home!

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.460
[man] Ah, you must be
Hiiragi's girlfriend.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.760
[Mom] Apparently not.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.430
[man] Oh, you're not?

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.890
- Welcome home.
- Oh, hey there, son.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.350
So, you left home to find this person,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.770
and you've been wandering
far and wide ever since?

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.980
Yeah. There's something
I need to give them.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.810
To give them?

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.280
- Here come my freshly fried croquettes!
- [girl gasps]

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.030
[Mom] I've got more in the kitchen,
so eat your fill.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.150
Whoa!

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.180
- Thank you for this meal.
- Thank you for this meal!

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.030
[electronic beep]

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.120
[TV] Well, everyone, it's summer
on the calendar but winter in the skies...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.830
[girl wails]

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.540
You knew that they would be hot.
You need to slow down a bit! Uh...

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.750
[both groaning]

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.300
- [Hiiragi] Really? You two as well?
- [both panting]

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.300
It's not easy to eat them like this,
but it's worth it.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.300
Right, Tsumugi?

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.890
Uh-huh! You said it! Yummy!

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.860
[TV] ...cold air moving down
from high altitudes.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.390
[Mom] The rain's really coming down now.
Why don't you stay the night?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.560
[Tsumugi] You don't mind?

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.100
- [Mom] We'd be glad to have you!
- [Tsumugi] Awesome!

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.690
Tsumugi? I'm leaving you
a change of clothes, okay?

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.400
Okay, great! Thanks a million!

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.660
[rain pattering]

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.330
Great, you're a huge help. I think that's
about as much as I can manage right now.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.330
[door slides open]

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.840
Mmm. That bath was so relaxing.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.090
Ah, mind if I borrow you for a second?

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.720
Great. Now, sit down.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.600
You mind if I brush your hair?

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.860
[chuckles softly]
Your hair's as soft and fine as it looks.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.030
I'm... glad you think so.
[chuckles nervously]

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.360
When I was your age,
my hair was just as unruly as Hiiragi's.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.620
My mom would set me down
and tame it with her brush.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.660
[Tsumugi] Really?
Your hair doesn't look unruly at all now.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.200
[Mom] It did calm down.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.460
Oh! Hey, Hiiragi.
About that talk we had earlier.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.380
I just hired a tutor
who can work with you right here at home.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.880
So you don't need cram school anymore!

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.380
What?! Why'd you do that?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.510
Why wouldn't I?

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.390
You're obviously gonna get
a lot more out of private lessons.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.390
Hold on. I already applied
for the summer course.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.770
Then it sounds like you'll have to cancel.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.140
- I could. But everyone else...
- Forget them!

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.980
You're your own person, aren't you?

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.770
You think you wanna go to cram school,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.280
but that's just because you feel like
it's safer to follow everyone else.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.190
No, that isn't...

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.780
[man, impatiently] Just listen
and do as I say,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.030
and you can't go wrong.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.780
Understood?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.040
[Hiiragi grunts, sighs]

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.040
[tense music playing]

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.210
Huh? Hiiragi?

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.540
[bottle cap tinkling]

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.540
Hmm.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.630
- Hello? Tsumugi?
- [door opens, shuts]

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.170
- [Tsumugi] I'm in here.
- Oh. Okay.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.300
Good. We're all done.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.510
- [girl] You wanna play a game?
- Yeah. Sounds good.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.300
Thanks for doing this.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560
[sighs]

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.690
Uh. Oh... Uh... [sighs]

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.730
Stupid screw-up.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.320
[gasps]

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.320
[groans, sobs]

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.070
[bubbling]

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.490
[both groaning]

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.700
[girl] Whoa!

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.660
[laughs]

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.660
You've lost three times in a row now!

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.710
Let me just try one more time.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.460
Huh?

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.090
[Hiiragi] It's cold.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.340
[moans softly]

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.640
[bubbling]

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.850
Snow?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.930
[unsettling music plays]

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.140
[growls]

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.860
[gasps] What the...

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.360
[hyperventilating]

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.110
[growls]

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.360
[whimpering]

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.780
- Huh!
- Hm?

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280
What's the matter?

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.080
[Tsumugi] I need the toilet!

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.990
But there's one downstairs!

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.210
[Tsumugi gasps] So cold!

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.670
It's frozen shut?

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380
Hey, Hiiragi!

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.590
[music intensifies]

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.260
[bubbling]

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.470
What the heck is this?

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.010
[gasps]

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.100
[creature wails]

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.270
[creature wails]

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.650
Hiiragi! Get it together!

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.900
We need to run!

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.240
Uh... Tsumugi?

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.160
[Tsumugi] Come on! This way!

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.070
[dramatic music playing]

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.910
[crackling]

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.460
[creature wails]

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.130
[Hiiragi panting]

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.760
[groans]

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.180
I think we're safe for the time being.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.180
Just what the heck... was that thing?

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.020
I don't know enough to guess.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.270
I'm trying to figure out
why it went after you.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.690
- Tsumugi...
- Hm?

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.320
You, uh, seem to have grown a horn.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.070
What is that?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.030
Oh, so you're able to see it now.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.410
I've... got a horn

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.450
because I'm an oni.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.370
[gasps]

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.910
And the reason I've come here

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.420
is to eat you, Hiiragi.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.210
[gasps]

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.590
Just kidding!

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.500
I would never eat a person.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.720
I really am an oni though. Are ya spooked?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.590
Uh... No, why would I be?

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.470
Huh? [gasps]

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.050
[bubbling]

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.640
[gasping] N... not again!

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.560
Relax. They're called mini-oni.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.230
I've never seen
such a dense cluster before.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.440
You don't say.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.280
[Tsumugi] They tend to leak out of people
who try to keep their feelings bottled up.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.820
You know, people like you.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.240
- So that thing's an oni?
- It sure is.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.990
And its proof that
you're hiding your fear.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.790
I don't have to hide anything!

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.410
[grunts]

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.000
[gasps] Hey! [grunts]

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.580
- Get back here!
- [Tsumugi laughing loudly]

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.920
- So where'd you come from, Tsumugi?
- Across the mountain.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.340
It's a place where oni live
called the Hidden Village.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.930
I left there because I wanna find my mom.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.810
She ran away when I was little
and left my dad and me all by ourselves.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.730
He did his best to raise me on his own.
But things were pretty hard for us.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.480
She sounds irresponsible, right?

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.570
I was thinking
of giving her a punch to the jaw!

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.530
Seems like you might
give her a few punches.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620
Right?

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.830
And she should be
at a shrine in this world.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.450
Hm? No! It's gone!

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.160
- Uh...
- Oh.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.920
I really can't afford to lose it!

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.710
- Without it, I... [moans]
- Oh!

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.550
[Tsumugi groaning]

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.300
You mean this?

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.380
Yeah!

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.130
Oh, thank goodness.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.760
Sorry. I should've
given it back to you sooner.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.510
Found it in my room.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.930
- It's from Hie Shrine, right?
- Uh?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.850
- That's a ways away.
- [shakily] Huh?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.980
- You mean, you know where it is?!
- Uh... Mm.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.480
[moans] Hiiragi, I... I need your help.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.320
You gotta guide me
to the Hie Shrine, okay?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.110
[gasps] I don't think I can.
I have to go to school tomorrow.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.320
And my parents...

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.790
The thing is, I just don't know
my way around in your world.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.870
So please help!

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.910
I want you to come with me, Hiiragi!

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.080
[echoing clang]

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.300
I guess... never mind.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.880
Sorry for asking for too much.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.680
- [Hiiragi] It's okay.
- Huh?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680
I'll help you.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.100
Awesome!

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.060
[tapping door gently]

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.140
Uh, Hiiragi?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.730
Is Tsumugi with you? Oh!

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.940
What happened?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.740
Hey, Mom! Hiiragi's gone too!

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.030
[playful music playing]

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.580
So why go to Hie Shrine?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.710
Because the last time she talked
to my dad before she ditched us,

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.420
my mom said that's where she was gonna go.
That's the only lead I've got.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.220
Have any guesses as to why
I've gained the ability to see mini-oni?

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.470
Well, the more like an oni you become,
the more of us you can see.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.060
[Hiiragi] But I'm not an oni.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.730
[Tsumugi] Humans who leak
lots of mini-oni become oni over time.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.600
And you've been leaking
some seriously tense ones.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.230
I bet you'll turn any moment now.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.310
[groans]

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.230
I will?!

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.280
Uh... Wait a second, d... does that mean
you started out as a human?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.780
No. I've been an oni
since the day I was born.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.080
[gentle music playing]

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.840
[music continues]

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.760
[birds chirping]

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.270
[both panting]

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.400
- [gasps softly] The sun's rising.
- Huh?

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.780
[Tsumugi gasps]

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.120
- [inhales sharply] It's pretty!
- Hmm.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.920
[music fades out]

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.920
[Mom] It's already morning.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.590
So it is.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.550
I'll go see
if I can't track him down somehow.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.260
- You stay here in case he comes back.
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.900
[Tsumugi moaning] Hiiragi!

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.900
I'm exhausted!

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.450
- Wanna look for a place to rest?
- [Tsumugi] Why don't we take a car?

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.820
Because we're broke. And taxis cost money.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.370
Oh! That's right!

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.200
We could just hitchhike
with someone who's heading to Yonezawa!

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.460
Uh... I think people are too scared
to give rides to strangers these days.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.340
The only way to find out
for a fact is to give it a try.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.250
I get that.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.840
Even if someone does pull over for us,
how'll we know we can trust them?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.340
You sure are full of reasons
not to do things.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.260
Fine.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.930
You keep on walking,
and I'll hitchhike without you.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.720
- We'll meet back up at the destination.
- Huh?!

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.150
[softly] Hm.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.580
- Why are you following me?
- 'Cause you left me no choice.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.540
[mini-oni bubbling]

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.710
- Liar.
- [Hiiragi] I'm not lying!

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.930
What's that kid playing at? Good grief.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.470
[Tsumugi] No, you do it like this!

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.720
You really gotta stick
your thumbs out there!

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.060
[groaning] Wait. Hold on!

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.980
They're as "out there" as they can be!

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.230
Mm, can't be helped.
I'll do this myself. [sighs]

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.730
Get out of my way.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.320
[Hiiragi groaning] W... wait!

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.280
[Hiiragi groans]

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.160
[woman laughing]

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.200
You two aren't trying
to hitchhike, are ya?

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.460
Yeah, we sure are.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.380
[man] Sorry we can't take ya further.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.380
Don't be. Getting a lift to this town
means we'll be halfway to our destination.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.260
So, tell me, are the two of you
on a lovers' getaway or what?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.180
- No. No way.
- No, it's not like that.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.640
[both laughing]

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.640
Well, don't you think
your parents are gonna worry?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.730
Uh. Well, I guess they might.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.140
All of these bags...

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.060
Hey, why do you have all this stuff?

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.480
Ah, we wanna start
a vintage clothing store.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.530
For now, it's fully mobile.
We move between different flea markets.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.410
But today, we're doing a stall
in a park in Yonezawa.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.160
I know! You two
should come hang out for a bit!

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.050
Just... a little further left, yeah?

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.420
Right there. Good job.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.220
That's great. Way easier to see.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.800
Wow, you sell a lot of things.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.720
Mm, there's a festival
goin' on nearby as well,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.720
so we're goin' after the kimono crowd.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.520
Excuse me.
Do you have this shirt in a smaller size?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.560
Nah, we only have the sizes on display.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.690
But we do have smaller shirts
in different patterns.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.690
- [Tsumugi] Hiiragi!
- [girl] Gotcha. This one's cute too!

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.740
When are we getting out of this place?

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.530
We owe them for giving us a ride,
so we gotta help them a bit to say thanks.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.950
Don't worry about it.
They were driving this way anyway.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.580
But we... can't just...

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.830
- [man 1] Hiiragi. Oh, and Tsumugi.
- Huh?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.750
I need to go
to the information desk for a little bit.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.750
You two mind lookin' after the stall?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.550
- [Hiiragi] Uh, no prob.
- Thank you.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.090
You can charge a bit less
than what's on the tags.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.800
You're in charge now!

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.970
- Just leave it to us!
- [groans]

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.890
[man 2] Excuse me.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.930
Let's say I pick up two of these.
Would that get me a discount?

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.690
[Hiiragi] Uh, that's right.
It's a hundred yen off when you buy two.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.820
How about this shirt?
Can I try it as well?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.110
Yeah. Here you go.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.860
[man 2] This is nice.
All right. I'll take this, and...

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.120
I hope you realize how beautiful you are.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200
[woman] You're cute.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.080
[coins jingle, tin rattles]

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.660
[indistinct chatter]

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.580
Wow, that's amazing.
You must be really smart.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.790
[man 3 laughing] Honestly? No, not at all!

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.710
Mio is... not very interested in the stall.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.970
Excuse me. This hat,
do you mind if my kid tries it on?

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.140
Oh, sure. Go for it.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.680
- Hey. Cool if I grab one of those?
- Yeah. You want a bandana?

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.020
- So cute! I want it!
- [mother chuckles softly]

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.020
Catch!

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.360
There. Things have finally calmed down.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.190
You two were a massive help today.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.990
I know it's not much of a reward,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.950
but if any of this caught your eye,
feel free to take it.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.030
That's really okay?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120
Awesome!

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.750
Seems like Ryuji and Mio
have been avoiding making eye contact.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.920
Do you think they might be having a fight?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.590
No. If you ask me,
it seems like they're always like this.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.880
And no one can understand
a couple's problems

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.430
except the couple themselves.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.310
That may be true, but I still wish
we could do something for them.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.140
You really wanna get
in the middle of that?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.810
Don't be pushy. You hate it when
your dad acts like he knows what you want

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.060
more than you do, right?

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.190
I do, but...

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:44.770
Still...

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.900
I'll be back in a bit.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.990
[footsteps departing]

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.990
Sheesh.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.540
[inaudible dialogue]

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.970
[Tsumugi] Those boys from earlier
already dumped you, huh?

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.800
[Mio] Oh, Tsumugi, it's you.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.180
No, that's not what happened.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.340
[Tsumugi] Hiiragi won't leave
until we've helped you,

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.720
and that inconveniences me.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.980
Helped me, how? With what?

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.440
You're dating a guy
you hide your feelings from.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.730
It's real obvious
that you're not in love with him.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.650
If something's eating at you,
then you gotta spit it out.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.610
Don't you feel sorry for him?

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.280
Are you talking about...

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.450
Oh!

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.740
No, you've got it wrong.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.620
Ryuji's actually my big brother.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.700
Huh?

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.540
But... you are right about the other thing.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.250
I do wish I could express myself
a little more freely with him.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.210
- [gasps]
- [fireworks squealing]

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.290
[people gasping]

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.550
Mio! Oh, you're here with Tsumugi.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.390
Ryuji.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.310
Hiiragi told me
that he thought you and I needed to talk.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.020
The kid had gotten himself
pretty worked up about it.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.020
I guess he realized
that we've been acting awkward.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.650
You feel like we've... been acting awkward?

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.820
[sad music playing]

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.700
I think that, since we were just kids,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.160
I've known that when I turned around,
you'd be right behind me.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.710
I thought you'd follow my lead because
you like the same things as me, you know?

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.130
I thought you liked
vintage clothes and flea markets.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.830
Yeah, I do.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.250
[Ryuji] Right.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.130
Part of me knew
that something else was off.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.260
But, for some reason,
I pretended not to notice.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.010
- [woman 1] Uh! Snow?!
- [man 1] Snow?!

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.930
[man 2] But how?

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.760
[woman 2] Uh, but it's summer!

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.060
[woman 3] How strange!

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.690
Huh? Snow? Again?

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.060
[creature wails]

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.690
Oh, what's that?

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.440
The thing from before!

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.450
Why is it here?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.700
[creatures wail]

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.080
[inaudible dialogue]

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.580
It's Mio and... Tsumugi. [gasps]

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.540
[Ryuji] You know, sis...

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.670
I've realized something.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.960
The idea that family members
can understand each other without speaking

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.090
is a big lie.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.380
So, from now on, I'd like to hear more
of what you have to say.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.470
[gasps]

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.850
Well, the truth is,
I have a whole lot of things I wanna say.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.270
And so do I, Mom.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.850
- [Hiiragi] Tsumugi!
- Huh?

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.860
Quick! Look above you!

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.230
What?! Wha...

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.740

[gasping]

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.540
[Ryuji] What happened?

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.620
[Mio] You okay?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.260
- She up and ran off!
- [Hiiragi] Thanks, Ryuji!

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.380
- She went that way!
- 'Kay. Thank you! For everything!

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.770
I thought that I was the one
the monster was after.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.810
Which way now?

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:07.890
[man wheezes]

Tsumugi! Are you here?

You okay?

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.450
[gasps] Mm, thank goodness.
She's breathing at least.

- [wind howling]
- Huh?

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:11.390
HOJU NO YU KINOENE HOT SPRINGS INN

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.320
- [leaves rustling]
- Whoa!

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.070
[Hiiragi groaning]

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.820
Uh... People?!

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.080
- [Hiiragi moaning]
- Hey, hey, hey! What happened to you?

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.330
You two look like you just took a beating.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.210
She's in a bad way. Tsumugi...

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.540
I'm begging you, please help her!

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.260
- [man] What's going on?
- She's hurt. Go get the first aid kit.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.470
What happened?

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.390
[Tsumugi] I just... [moans]

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.220
She was knocked out cold
when I found her by the riverbed.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.480
Seems like she took a bad fall.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.060
Oh. Well, take her to room 206,
then, would you, dear?

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.150
I'm on it.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.860
[man] Got that first aid kit right here!

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.610
[footsteps slowly approaching]

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.780
[door opens]

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:08.870
[grunting softly]

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.250
- It's morning.
- [Hiiragi] Uh... Good morning, ma'am.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.830
[woman] Mm-hmm.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.760
Hmm.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.220
Seems she isn't awake yet
because she's running a fever.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.640
Do help me get in touch with her parents.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.640
That's not... quite possible.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.270
It isn't? Why's that?

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.100
Don't tell me she's a runaway.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.650
Listen, I need this room
available for customers.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.650
Help me reach her parents.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.900
I'm sorry, ma'am. But I really can't.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.740
Can you at least explain why?

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.650
No.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.910
But until she feels better,
I'm begging you to let us stay here.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.410
Yet you refuse to tell me why I should.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.920
I'm happy to earn our keep.
Until she wakes up, I'll work for you.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.920
Answer my questions first!

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.920
I'm a hard worker.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.340
Please let us stay. You won't regret it.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.380
[laughing]

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.840
[Hiiragi grunts] Um...

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.720
You're certainly a stubborn one.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.060
And despite your youth,
you're eager to work.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.140
Perhaps you would be able
to teach my husband a thing or two.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.440
[upbeat music playing]

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.850
[man] Have a good day!

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.950
Once you're done brushing in there,
fill up these shampoo bottles, 'kay?

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040
Sure.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.000
- Hiiragi!
- Huh?

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.250
- Be sure to vacuum up here too.
- Yes, ma'am!

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.460
- Oh. Ah.
- And be careful!

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.260
- [groans]
- You don't have to carry that much.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.430
- Just get what you can.
- Uh, sure.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.510
[man] Newbie!

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.430
Got you a fresh bucket.
I'll leave it here, 'kay?

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.970
Okay, thanks for grabbing it.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.350
[Tsumugi moans softly]

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.310
[grunts, pants]

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.190
It was your idea
to work and earn your keep.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.240
So make sure you're able to keep at it.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.570
Uh... right!

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.530
[man 2] Good grief!
What age are you living in?

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.780
She means to say, "Don't work too hard."

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.910
- How about you get back to work?
- [man 2] Yikes.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
[music fades out]

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.340
[rumbling approaching]

[horn blares]

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.760
[horn blaring]

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.480
- [Tsumugi moans softly]
- [gentle piano music playing]

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.860
[grunting, gasps softly]

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320
[child whoops]

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.170
[gasps]

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.050
[grunts]

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.800
[grunts]

[horn blares]

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360
Hey, wait!

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.110
Wait for me!

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.740
[ethereal music playing]

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.210
[Tsumugi grunting]

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.960
[echoes] Mom!

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.220
[music fades out]

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.140
[gasping] Oh.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:32:59.930
Oh.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.930
Huh?

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.730
[weakly] That's right.
I've been at some kind of inn.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.810
- [door opens]
- Hm?

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.190
Hiiragi.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.450
Oh, Tsumugi! You finally woke up.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.200
- You changed your clothes.
- [Hiiragi] How do you feel?

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.780
I've changed clothes too.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.330
Don't tell me you did this.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.330
No! Of course not!

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.410
It was the owner.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.580
Hm. Also, she told me to bring you this.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.050
- Mmm!
- [chuckles softly]

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.930
What is this thing? It tastes so yummy!

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.100
Yep. I've never had onigiri
like this before.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.350
So I'm glad you're feeling better now.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.980
Has it been you
taking care of me this whole time?

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.820
Uh-uh. The only thing I did was carry you
here when I found you passed out.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.990
We owe the people who run this inn a lot.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.070
They gave you medical treatment
and put us both up in this room.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.410
[Tsumugi chuckles softly]
They're really nice, huh?

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.830
- Mm.
- [Tsumugi] Whoa!

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.450
This rolled omelet is crazy fluffy!

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.790
I can't believe it!

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.790
[Hiiragi] Ugh! Is that a bad thing?

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460
[phone buzzes]

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.430
Thank you for the food, sir.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.810
- That onigiri was incredible.
- [man] Glad to hear it.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.190
So is Tsumugi feeling better now?

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.900
- Yeah. And it's thanks to you.
- That's wonderful news.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.400
By the way, I've noticed that you smoke.

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.820
Oh? You spotted me, did ya?

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.620
The old ball and chain
is always telling me to quit

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.500
so I won't stink the place up
and bother our customers.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.410
My dad likes to go out and smoke too.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.380
Have you found a chance
to talk to your parents lately?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
No.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.510
Well, I suppose that's the way it goes.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.800
Still, I'll say this, Hiiragi.
Sometimes, when people wait too long

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.510
to say what they need to,
they miss their chance.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.100
So, once you're feeling up to it,

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.640
you should let your parents know
that you're okay.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.730
[Tsumugi moaning gently]

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.650
[grunts softly]

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.320
[inhales, exhales deeply]

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.300
Here you are. I laundered it
and stitched up the tears for you.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.380
[Tsumugi] You sure did.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.050
It's like brand-new!

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:41.970
Thank you.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.220
It's that boy you should be thanking.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.100
While you were recovering in here,
he worked very hard around the inn

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.600
so that you two could stay.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.850
[Tsumugi] Hm.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.520
Hey there, Mom.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.730
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.190
Well, a lot happened.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.110
I'm staying at the Hoju no Yu inn
for the time being.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.320
What about Tsumugi? Is she there?

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.450
Okay. Well, that's good.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.620
So when can we expect you to be back?

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.960
I've got something
that I have to see through.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.420
I'll come back after.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.920
But I really am just fine, so don't worry.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.340
Yeah. See you.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.140
- [man grunts]
- [chuckles softly]

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.100
[upbeat piano music playing]

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.440
We really appreciate your help.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.020
To be honest, it was no trouble.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.150
- Having you with us was quite fun.
- Mm.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.150
I think I'll miss this place.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.410
And I see you're still a kid.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.410
A little word of advice. You'll need
to be strong if you wanna protect Tsumugi.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.120
- Oh...
- [chuckles]

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.170
Well, here at the inn,
we're used to saying goodbye. So, bye.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.250
Come back soon.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.420
- Right. And again, thanks so much...
- Thank you so much.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.920
...for everything you've done.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.260
[Tsumugi] See you later!

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.680
[man] Come back
and visit us anytime you'd like!

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.430
[upbeat music continues]

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.190
How long will it be
till we reach Hie Shrine?

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.190
I'm pretty sure
we should get there this evening.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.780
I see.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.610
So we're close now.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.450
- [grunts, gasps]
- [gasps]

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.280
[both loudly gasp]

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.960
Wow! So cool!

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.840
I've never seen anything like this!

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.260
Me neither!

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.930
TV doesn't do this place justice at all!

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.890
[Tsumugi] Of course not!
Did you think it would?

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.010
[Hiiragi] Can you just let me
express my thoughts?

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.020
[Tsumugi] Fine! If I must!

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.650
[music fades out]

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.690
[tires squeal]

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.910
[concierge] Welcome, sir.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:13.240
Hey, you there! I've heard my son,
Hiiragi, has been staying here!

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.450
[concierge] Hiiragi? Uh...
Then, are you Hiiragi's...

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.580
- I'm his father!
- [gasps]

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.850
- [door opens]
- [concierge] Huh?

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.750
Welcome to our humble inn, sir.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.040
Does an urgent matter require attention?

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.720
Yeah, you been keepin' my son here,
and I wanna see him this instant!

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.550
I'm afraid he's already left.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.550
Where to?

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.300
Hurry up and tell me right now!

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.970
What an impatient man you are.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.180
Do you think I have time to waste
on people who aren't customers?

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.060
- What a rude thing to assume.
- Huh?

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.730
Let's both calm down
and take our time in the back.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.610
This way, sir.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.320
Uh... Huh?

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.790
So what's the Hidden Village like, anyway?

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.670
Mmm, let me think.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.840
Well, first of all, it's super cold there.
I mean, it snows all year round.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.710
That's normal for us oni though.
We don't mind it a bit.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.420
I see.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.430
Do you think
that you'll go back to the Hidden Village

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.890
once you've met your mom?

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.770
Yeah! I'll go back.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:17.850
[Hiiragi] I see.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980
[Tsumugi] Hm?

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:27.320
[chuckles] What's the matter, Hiiragi?
[teasing] You scared you'll miss me?

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.150
No! I was just kinda curious!

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.070
[grunts] Not again!

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.910
- Hey! [groans]
- [Tsumugi laughing]

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.740
[Hiiragi] What is your mom like?

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.870
Can't say I remember.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.670
I was just three years old
when she left me and my dad.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:45.170
Are... you still planning to punch her
once you've tracked her down?

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.300
Hmm. I definitely want to reserve
the right to punch her if she needs it.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.800
But, before that, I think I'll at least
give her a chance to explain why she left.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.310
I mean, who knows?

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.560
Maybe she had
a surprisingly good reason to.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.640
Yeah.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.350
Honestly, I don't think
I'll know how to feel

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.650
or what I'll want until I'm in the moment.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.860
You're probably right.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.940
- [Tsumugi gasps]
- Hm?

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.610
[mystical jingling]

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.700
[gentle piano music playing]

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.370
That looks like...

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.290
- [grunts]
- Uh... Tsumugi?

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.580
[Tsumugi sighs] Hm?

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880
[Hiiragi sighs].

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.000
[footsteps approaching]

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.760
- [man] You two customers?
- [Tsumugi] Hm?

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.220
[Hiiragi] Oh... Sorry to intrude.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.510
We were just looking at the art
on the folding screen you've got in there.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.140
But, uh... we don't have any money.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.520
- We should... get going.
- [Tsumugi] It's fine. We're just looking.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.480
- [Hiiragi, quietly] Yeah, but it's a café.
- I've got no customers at the moment.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.440
So you can come in and take a closer look
if you're interested.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.110
- Wanna see another angle?
- Oh! Thank you very much, sir.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.200
Awesome!

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.370
[Tsumugi] I was once told

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.040
that the reason the Hidden Village
was able to stay hidden

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.750
is because of our relationship
with the local gods,

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.670
who cloaked the village in snow.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.380
We called them Snow Gods.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.210
Until pretty recently,
I thought they were a fairy tale.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.380
But maybe
it's a Snow God that attacked us.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:19.100
Although... no one ever told me
they ate oni.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.560
[rattling]

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.180
Uh...

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.810
[man] I'm experimenting
with a new herbal tea blend.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.900
Try it, please.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.400
I'd love to get your opinion
about how it tastes.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.610
[loud gulping]

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.320
Ah! So good!

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.740
[Hiiragi] It really is delicious.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.700
Been wanting to try out
these new tea leaves I bought.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.960
- This seemed like a good chance.
- So where do these tea leaves come from?

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.710
I think these ones
were from the Czech Republic.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.960
But I get leaves
from Sweden and Egypt too.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.670
I'm still able to get my hands on
some unique products,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.430
thanks to friends I made
when I traveled in my youth.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:00.300
Wow, cool!

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.640
Did you travel alone?

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.720
No. Went with my wife.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.520
She passed away about four years ago.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600
[softly] Oh.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.480
You know,
I have some pictures of us over here.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.610
That's my wife standing right next to me.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.490
She's wearing something
known as a Basotho hat.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:21.330
It's a traditional hat
from the country of Lesotho in Africa.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.290
It was designed to resemble
the shape of a mountain.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.920
- Wow! It's really interesting.
- [Tsumugi] Uh-huh.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.880
Ah, then you'll be pleased to know
that it's now on your head.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.790
[Hiiragi] Uh.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.840
- And this is a traditional Inuit hat.
- Uh!

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.180
I wore it
when we traveled to northern Canada

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.350
so we could get a look at the Aurora.
Warmest hat I know of.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.600
Town we stayed in
drops to minus 40 degrees Celsius.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.730
[both] Minus 40 degrees Celsius?!

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:47.810
[grunts]

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.310
[laughs]

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.440
You two make quite a pair in those hats.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.900
[poignant music playing]

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.320
[Hiiragi] So then, all the things here

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.610
hold memories
that you made with your wife.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.070
[Tsumugi] That's lovely.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.240
Oh, where did you get that folding screen?

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.120
[man] It was actually
one of the few things

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.200
that came with the house
when we bought it.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.960
I believe that it was made by a local,
but I don't know who the artist was

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.460
or even how long ago
they might've painted it.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.960
Looks like it's telling a story, right?

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.590
I think it might be.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.420
And that story might even be true.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.470
Maybe Snow Gods... ate oni.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.390
[door opens]

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.470
[woman] I told you to be careful,
didn't I? We're back!

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.810
Please try really hard
not to lose it again.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.980
- [child grunts]
- I'm glad you're confident at least. Uh...

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.520
Oh, customers?

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.230
- [man] Welcome back.
- Nice to meet you.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.730
That's my daughter
and my grandson, Haruto.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.490
- [Tsumugi] Hello.
- [Hiiragi] Hi! Sorry to intrude.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.360
[woman] Go ahead, Haruto. Say hello.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.580
Hello there! [babbles]

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.740
So cute.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.700
'Kay, let's wash your hands
and get you some juice.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.410
Oh...

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.770
- [Haruto] Your heads look weird!
- Huh?

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.000
[woman] Hey! Be nice!

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.010
- I'm sorry, you two. Take your time!
- [Haruto laughing]

00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.340
[footsteps retreating]

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:03.010
[man] This café is full of treasures
that remind me of my wife, yes.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.600
But I treasure those two
more than anything in this world.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.270
I guess I feel as though
I'm passing down my legacy.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.980
My love for them
is like a force of nature.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.520
Oh jeez! I'm real sappy these days.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.030
Guess it's just a hazard of getting older.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.860
[Tsumugi sighs] It's raining.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.620
And we're still a fair distance
from the shrine. Okay with getting wet?

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.620
Or just take this with you.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.540
Oh. We couldn't possibly.
You've been so nice to us already. Uh...

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.960
There's no need to bring it back.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.540
But next time you're in the neighborhood,
come buy some tea.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.800
- [Haruto] Hey!
- Hey! Slow it down!

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:41.800
Bye-bye!

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.380
Bye-bye!

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.550
[moving music playing]

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.480
Hey. About the art on that folding screen...

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:56.810
[Tsumugi] Mm. I think
those were Snow Gods.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.610
But since they were attacking oni,

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.070
I wonder if the village is okay?

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:04.530
[Hiiragi] Hm.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.540
Before we found the café,
you asked me if I was planning

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.580
on going back to the Hidden Village
once I'm able to find my mom, right?

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.040
- Yeah.
- I think I'll need to go home.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.340
I can't just leave my dad all by himself.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:23.130
But someday...

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:24.930
Hey. Wait up!

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:28.100
I wanna see as much of the world as I can!

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.680
Lesotho's supposed to be
really hot, right?

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.100
Wonder if it snows there?

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:36.350
Before today, I had no idea there was
a town colder than the Hidden Village.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.860
There must be so many kinds of people.
So many ways of seeing things!

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:45.110
I only came out here to find my mom,
but I've gotten to learn so much!

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.610
Oh, and meeting you was all right too!

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.240
Huh? Did you really
have to phrase it like that?

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.330
[Tsumugi laughs]

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.710
So, what about you? What do you wanna do?

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.880
Uh... honestly,
I haven't given it much thought.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.130
It can be anything!
Just say whatever you're feeling!

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.670
Well, I guess... at the moment,

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.510
I really just wanna make sure
that I do my best for you.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.260
- [grunts] Is that bad?
- [Tsumugi chuckles softly]

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.850
You won't hear me complaining!

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.100
[both panting]

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.780
Hiiragi. I just thought of
one more thing I'd really like to do.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.370
The thing is, there's no way
that I can make it happen without you.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.280
So you'll promise to help me, right?

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.040
Oh... I can't promise
till I know what you want though.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:37.750
That's odd.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.540
I could've sworn I just heard you say
you wanted to do your best for me.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.920
I did, but...

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.050
[grunts] Okay, fine, then.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.550
[gulps, sighs softly]

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.510
When we finish this journey,

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.810
you need to have
a serious talk with your dad.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:58.060
[groans] Where the heck
is this coming from?

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.940
This good-luck charm will help you do it.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.060
CHILDBIRTH CHARM

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.070
- But it's...
- Don't worry!

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:06.860
It's extremely effective.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:11.410
- After all, it did bring me this far.
- That isn't what I meant.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.740
- [Tsumugi] Give it back when you're done.
- [scoffs]

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.830
I wonder when that'll be.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.330
Uh... Snow!

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.710
[mystical music playing]

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.960
Is a Snow God here, then? [gasps softly]

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.210
[music becomes dramatic]

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.840
[both gasping]

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.220
Duck! Oh!

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.680
Hiiragi!

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.680
[wails]

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.560
[tires squeal]

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.530
Sorry, Hiiragi!

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:54.490
Over here!

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.120
[Hiiragi panting]

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.750
Tsumugi!

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:18.930
[grunts] Hiiragi!

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.430
[over PA] Doors closing.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.940
Please stand clear of the doors
as they close.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.310
Grab my hand!

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:25.900
Tsumugi!

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:28.610
- [door chiming]
- Come on! [grunts]

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:34.450
[squeals]

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.950
[banging at doors]

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:43.170
[music fades out]

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.680
We're nearly at the shrine.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.890
Huh? Oh.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480
[moans softly]

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:16.200
HIE SHRINE

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.120
- [grunts]
- [grunts]

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:45.850
Hm.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.280
[gasps]

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:02.790
Mom?

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.660
[wind howling]

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.550
How... Wait, Tsumugi?

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:16.470
Huh? It's my dad!

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:17.550
[gulps]

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:19.530
- [rapid footsteps]
- Mm... Uh... The... Sorry...

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:20.890
[Dad] I finally found you!

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.850
Hang on. What is this?

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.440
[grunts] What are you doing here, Dad?
Where's Mom?

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.890
Where is she?!

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.190
You won't find her here.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:32.520
Why not?!

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.070
This is the place
that you told me she ran off to!

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.780
I'm sorry, Tsumugi.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.990
It never occurred to me back then that
you would decide to come all this way.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.870
I don't care what you thought!

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.240
Just tell me the truth
about where she is now!

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.750
I'd like to.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.500
But I cannot.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.330
Why are you hiding it?!

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.210
If there's a reason I can't meet her,
I deserve to know!

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.840
Or did...

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.630
Did Mom say... to keep me away
because she doesn't wanna see me?

00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.800
It's not that!

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.390
[Tsumugi] I see.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.180
Then... is she already dead?

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:08.520
[Dad] She's alive!

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.810
She's just out of reach.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.900
And...

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.650
Never mind that. There's been trouble
at the Hidden Village.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:17.840
- The Snow Gods have been acting...
- "Never mind that"?!

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.530
She is my mother!
How could I ever not mind?

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.990
Why are y... you so...

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.830
[moans softly] I've had enough!

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.870
[Hiiragi] Tsumugi! Uh...

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.130
[Dad sighs]

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.040
[emotional piano music playing]

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.130
[Hiiragi sighs]

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.380
Hey, um, you should know...

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.180
She might be angry, but she's also been
worried about you this whole time.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.640
As soon as she found her mom,

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.810
she was planning to go back
to the Hidden Village to live with you.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.480
Who are you?

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.730
Hiiragi Yatsuse.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.270
I'm Tsumugi's friend.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.360
Excuse me.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.200
[exhales]

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.340
Tsumugi?

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.090
- [Tsumugi] Leave me alone.
- I can't.

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.600
Sorry. I really wanna be
by myself right now.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.930
We should go back.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.850
It seems like...
Your dad must be worried sick.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.100
You think so?

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.480
Maybe if I worry him more,
he'll tell me the truth about my mom.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.280
He must be thinking
it's something he has to protect you from.

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:44.990
Or maybe there's something
he's not able to say.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.870
That makes no sense.

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:49.700
You know that
he's not doing it to hurt you.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:51.870
Don't you?

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.630
Oh. So you two think the truth'll hurt me
more than the years of getting lied to?

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.300
N... no. That's not what I was saying.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.550
I know he wants to protect me.

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:09.180
Ever since I was a kid,
I've been thinking about this every day.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.350
How could it ever be in my interest to
not know why I don't get to have a mom?

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.900
It "seems like" he cares, huh?!

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.320
Why would I care
what things "seem like" to you?

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.940
'Cause I care.
I'm thinking about what's best for you!

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.280
That right there!

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.280
You sound exactly like your dumb dad!

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.330
I'm not asking you to think for me!

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:32.000
- You just wanna feel like you care!
- What about you?

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.960
When will you stop playing the victim

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.460
and think about
someone else's feelings for once?

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.170
- [groans]
- [gasps]

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
[breathes shakily]

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.800
- Sorry. Are you okay...
- [quickly] I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.770
Look, I'm grateful that
you helped me get to the shrine.

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:55.060
But you should back off and move on.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.570
[sighs] It's all wrong.

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:05.570
That wasn't what I... wanted to tell her.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160
I...

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:36.600
[breathing shakily] How could you?

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.450
[mini-oni bubbling]

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.620
[door opens, shuts]

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.000
I found you!

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:02.130
Sure took long enough.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:04.630
Where's Hiiragi?

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:06.010
Where's my boy?

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:09.470
That way?

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.510
[Tsumugi] Why'd you come after him?

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:16.770
Because that's what a father should do.

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:20.650
[door opens, shuts]

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.610
I've had enough.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.170
Huh? More snow?

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.540
[grunting softly]

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460
Hm?!

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.880
Hiiragi!

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:47.630
[tires squeal]

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760
Hiiragi!

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:55.350
[music intensifies]

00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:59.810
Hiiragi! Listen to me! [groans]

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.270
The truth is, I just...

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:08.690
Hiiragi.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.780
[music fades out]

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.330
[inaudible]

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.540
[Dad] Oh!

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.420
Hiiragi?

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.290
Where'd you go?

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.380
Hiiragi?

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.380
[screaming] Hiiragi!

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.720
[footsteps approaching]

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:38.850
Tsumugi!

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.560
- Tsumugi, about before...
- Sorry.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.310
- I'll go home now.
- [gasps softly]

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.940
We actually cannot.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.780
Have you encountered
a Snow God in this world?

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:55.820
Oh. That was a Snow God.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.870
First, the Snow Gods
started appearing all over the place.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.870
And then they started attacking oni.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.040
- [tires squeal]
- Going back isn't an option now.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.480
- What'll happen to everyone else?
- [door opens]

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.060
Several people have been eaten already.

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.330
- [door shuts]
- [Tsumugi gasps]

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.980
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Hiiragi's dad] Hey, you two!

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.510
- [Tsumugi] Huh?
- Have you seen Hiiragi again?

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:19.220
- [Tsumugi] You weren't able to find him?
- I did, but then... [gasps softly]

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.430
...he somehow disappeared
right before my eyes.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.520
[gasps]

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.600
No way.

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:27.730
[inhales sharply]

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.190
- I'll be back.
- [Dad] Don't!

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.690
There's no saving him now.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.610
- Hey.
- But I...

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.260
- What are you talkin' about?
- Tsumugi.

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.050
- What happened to my son?
- I wish I'd come to bring you home.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:39.260
- The truth is, our home isn't safe.
- Who is this guy, anyway?

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.700
- Hey!
- Will you shut your mouth for a moment?

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:43.830
Uh... yeah.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.330
[mystical jingling]

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.460
- [gasps]
- What is it?

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:51.090
Think there's a chance... he's still...

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:54.380
'Cause I care!
I'm thinking about what's best for you!

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.970
Tsumugi!

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.050
I'm glad you're feeling better.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.140
[gentle piano music playing]

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.930
[Tsumugi] Dad, I'm sorry.

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.560
- [gasps]
- [Tsumugi] But I...

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.650
I have to go apologize to him.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:14.070
[gasps] Tsumugi!

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.070
Hey! Hold on!

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.110
[shouting] Explain yourselves, will ya?

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:31.130
[breathing shakily]

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:32.880
Thank you so much!

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.380
We'll never forget
the sacrifice you've made for us!

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:40.640
Our future is in your hands.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:44.680
I have no doubt
that you're going to make us all proud.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.920
[wailing]

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:19.840
[man] The Snow Gods
are blessing us once more!

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.680
[woman 1] Don't leave me alone!

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.680
[woman 2] Now we can all
live in peace again.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.850
[woman 1] I need you.

00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:28.180
- Tsumugi.
- [woman 1] Tsumugi.

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:32.520
[music fades out]

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.280
[wailing]

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.970
[man] There's a Snow God here!

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.220
- You get that gate closed!
- [man] Let's move!

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.480
[Hiiragi moaning softly]

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.450
[woman panting]

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.870
[woman groaning]

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.200
Are you okay?

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.620
[groans] Oh... [gasps softly]

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:30.580
Tsumugi...

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.130
Tsumugi? Who are you,
and how do you know her?

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.710
I'm so sorry.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.880
[sighs]

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.880
[man] Hey! Is that kid all right?

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.510
Looked to me
like he came out of a Snow God.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:47.140
He's still alive at least.
We need to get him to the tower.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:49.770
[both panting]

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:50.850
[horn beeping]

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.350
[Hiiragi's dad] Get in!

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.690
You know where my son is, so help me!

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.940
[door mechanism beeps]

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.910
[door mechanism beeps]

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.120
- Let's go.
- Thank you!

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:14.000
Tsumugi, what you told me.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.040
- You sure it's true?
- Mm.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:18.590
I saw a picture in this world.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:20.550
In that picture, I saw the Snow Gods.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.300
The eaten oni weren't dead.
Just moved somewhere else.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.800
So maybe we could still save him.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.930
- [Snow God wails]
- [woman screams]

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:31.180
More civilians? Go on ahead!

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:34.270
- [Snow God wails]
- Homare!

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:35.850
[woman screams]

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940
[gasps] No!

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.690
[Snow God squeals]

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:41.230
[man 1 yells with effort]

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360
[man 2] Isami!

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:46.030
[mother and baby sobbing]

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.570
We have to go!

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.200
- But he...
- Get moving.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.790
[both panting]

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.330
Are you awake now?

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.330
- [Hiiragi groans]
- Good. Then run. Hurry up!

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.670
[mystical music playing]

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.480
[gasping]

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.900
[music intensifies]

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480
[man 1] This way!

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.270
Come on.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.490
[man 2] Hey! You all right?

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.040
[quietly] There's no way we can bring him
back to the Hidden Village.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120
Mm.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.420
I'm so sorry, but I need the toilet!

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.460
- Huh? Right now?
- I don't think I can hold it!

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.920
[door mechanism beeps]

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.720
[Tsumugi] Gotta be quick!

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.590
- Good grief.
- [door mechanism beeps]

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.050
- Hm?
- [footsteps retreating]

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.850
Uh? Hey!

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.730
- Wait a sec, will y...
- [crunch]

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:56.680
Hell.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.560
- The heck?
- [car horn blaring]

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.980
- [grunting]
- [rattling]

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.480
[car horns blaring]

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.480
[Hiiragi's dad] What's goin' on here?!

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:10.490
[footsteps approaching]

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:14.530
Sorry for the wait.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.120
- You're truly determined to go back?
- Yeah, of course I am.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.210
Then wear this.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080
Let's go.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:26.130
[chuckles softly]

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.570
- [man 1] Faster!
- [man 2] Let's go!

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:33.030
- [man 3] Hurry up!
- [man 4] What's wrong?

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.660
- [man 5] I'm there now!
- [man 6] Got it!

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.890
[shouting continues]

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:38.060
[woman 1] First,
I'll have you meet Chief Gozen.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.190
Do your best to be polite, okay?

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.610
[man 7] Great. Carry it all in.
Grab whoever you need.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:46.860
[man 8] It's heavy.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900
Ready, and...

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.410
We can't slow down yet.
Let's give it one more push, people!

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.490
- Right!
- Right!

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:54.870
[indistinct shouting]

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:56.790
- [woman 1] We're here.
- Oh.

01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:01.580
[Gozen] We'll still have as much medicine
here as I think we're likely to need.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.340
Don't wait
for the medical squad to arrive.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.840
Go straight to the site.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.970
Your first priority
should be to get that medicine delivered.

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:13.220
You won't be going by yourself.
I'll assign you some guards.

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.850
But still,
you should exercise every caution.

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:19.060
Good luck out there.

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.730
[woman 2] Ma'am!

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:24.400
I'll be back soon.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Follow me.

01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:30.650
[Gozen] Oh, wow! [laughing]

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.200
Hey, Toko,
take a look at the size of this bubble.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.870
A remarkable achievement, chief.
You may have set a new world record.

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:41.000
I bet I have, and now it almost feels like
a waste to eat the thing.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.250
[woman 1] Reporting in.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:45.960
A few minutes ago, a Snow God
entered the village from the sky, and...

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.920
[Gozen] And popped this boy out
onto a snowbank. I know!

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.170
Uh, right.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.130
But the boy's a new face here.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.630
And his horn seems new.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.680
Has he only just become an oni?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760
Huh?

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.970
[grunts, gasps]

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.180
A horn?

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.100
Hm! The town has an entrance,

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.770
but falling from the sky
does turn more heads.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.190
Tell me, how did you make it
out of the Snow God?

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:09.440
Uh...

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.490
[Gozen] The youngsters that brought you
here saw you burst out of a Snow God

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:14.700
as it disappeared.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.990
So how did you get out?
What do you remember?

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:19.530
Well, uh...

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.040
I remember the Snow God eating me.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.210
Then it got really cold.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.210
And I think I might've heard some voices?

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.960
But I... I can't be sure.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.050
This Snow God business.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.800
People used to claim
the Snow Gods were our guardians.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.300
Ones who keep
the Hidden Village shrouded in snow

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.470
and invisible to prying human eyes.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.850
But just look at what's happening now.

01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:45.480
The Snow Gods have started attacking us.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.980
Mmm. Delicious!

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.120
There isn't much I can tell you.
Let's start by talking to Gozen.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.670
[metal clanking]

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.220
- Strange. [grunting]
- [Tsumugi] What's wrong?

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.930
- [Dad] This turnstile's jammed.
- [clanking continues]

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:22.680
- Oh... Dad!
- [man] Izuru!

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:26.060
Under martial law, it's a crime to leave.
You should know that.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.560
We're in a hurry,
so help me get out of this thing!

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.690
Sure, I'll get you out.
But you're spending the night in custody.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.400
- [quietly] Tsumugi, go on without me.
- You sure?

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:38.160
It's fine. I'll figure out
a way to catch up with you.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240
Now go!

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.120
[man] Huh? Oh... Hey!

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.450
Get back here!

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.750
[Tsumugi gasps]

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:47.580
[both grunting]

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.210
- Go after her!
- Uh, yeah.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.130
[mystical music playing]

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.220
[breathing heavily]

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.930
[weakly] Where'd she run off to?

01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:11.610
[breathing shakily]

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.410
[yelping]

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.180
[music ends]

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.150
So, uh...

01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:54.650
Have you remembered something new?

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:57.400
When I was inside of that Snow God,

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.780
it felt like
I was having this strange dream.

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:01.450
I saw a mask.

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:03.570
And I heard bells.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.180
- Snow Gods were flying around me.
- [gasps] What? It's Hiiragi.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.330
[Hiiragi] And a girl
was looking at the snow.

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:14.380
Then... I heard a woman say,
"Don't leave me alone."

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.340
- Then she said, "Tsumugi."
- [Tsumugi gasps]

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:21.510
[Hiiragi] Then again,
maybe I was the one calling to Tsumugi?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640
I'm not sure.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.930
- [Gozen] Perhaps this is our punishment.
- Uh?

01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:31.980
In the deepest recesses
of the Hidden Village,

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.060
there's a place called Oni Island,
which is home to a shrine,

01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:37.020
wherein there sits the Spirit Mask

01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:39.940
that we've long used
to summon the Snow Gods.

01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:42.200
The Spirit Mask has powers?

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.110
That's right.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.330
It's what makes the Snow Gods
keep our home hidden from humans.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:48.370
[slurps]

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:50.120
I'm confused.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.710
Why's it so important
the village stay hidden?

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.710
[Gozen] You might understand a bit,
now that you've become an oni.

01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:00.920
No matter what country you go to
or what era you find yourself in,

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.470
there will be those who can only live
by suppressing their feelings.

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:08.970
These people need a place where
they're safe and free to be themselves.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.890
That's what this place is.
And that's why I must protect it.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.980
- [Tsumugi] Hmm!
- [footsteps approaching]

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.940
So, if we destroy this mask,

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.900
then the Snow Gods will leave us alone.
Is that right?

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.650
Didn't realize you were back... Tsumugi.

01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:26.740
Hi, Hiiragi.

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.700
You were tough to find.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.780
Tsumugi!

01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:31.750
If you break the mask,

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:34.250
then our Hidden Village
will be hidden no longer.

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:37.000
And what will happen
if everyone gets eaten?

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.590
I don't see much point
in a village without people.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:42.670
Oh, Hiiragi.

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:45.470
You turned into an oni.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:47.600
[Hiiragi shakily] Yeah.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.730
I bet you must be hungry.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:54.270
Let's grab a bite together.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.860
Chief Gozen, can we raid the food pantry?
I'm super hungry.

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.730
Sure, knock yourselves out.

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.440
- Let's go. Hiiragi.
- [Hiiragi] Okay.

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:06.030
Tsumugi. You're not...
going to go there, are you?

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120
Hey, Toko?

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.290
Look after those kids for me, would you?

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.080
They worry me.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:20.170
[Toko] Understood.

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:23.130
[indistinct background chatter]

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.550
Hiiragi... I'm so sorry.

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:28.930
I, uh, said some awful things
back at the park.

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.390
Same here.

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:34.180
Sorry. I shouldn't have tried
to push my feelings onto you like that.

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:36.060
[rattling]

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.020
[woman] Excuse me, dears.

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:41.110
[both chuckle softly]

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.730
[man in distance] It seems secure!

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:47.860
[man] This is no time to act out.

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:50.070
I can't believe you.

01:10:58.670 --> 01:10:59.880
[men grunt]

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.380
[grunting]

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:08.380
[man] You stupid... Wait!
What are you... [groaning]

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:09.840
[yelling]

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.850
- [loud thud]
- [man groaning]

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:13.430
Sorry.

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:15.140
[man] Wait! Izuru!

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.600
[child] Get ready! Catch!

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:20.150
[Hiiragi] You're planning
to go to Oni Island, aren't you?

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:22.650
Oh, uh... I wasn't planning on it.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.900
We'll go together.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.700
No, we won't.
You need to stay here where it's safe.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.240
I just wanna be wherever you are.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.950
Well, even so...

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.710
Well, this is the food pantry.

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:44.460
There should be lots of stuff in here
that's ready to eat.

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:50.430
- [Hiiragi gasps]
- Cool, right?

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:53.180
- Grab whatever you want. Go ahead.
- [chuckles]

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.770
[Hiiragi] This is amazing.
There's so much in here.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.060
- [door squeaks, bangs]
- Huh?

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.020
- Tsumugi?
- [metallic jangle]

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.440
I... is something wrong?

01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:05.150
Oh...

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.860
[grunts] Tsumugi!

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.070
[gentle piano music playing]

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.070
Open the door! Please! Tsumugi!

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.330
- Tsumugi!
- [banging at door]

01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:19.000
I'm sorry, but there's no way
I could take you.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.420
You still have a chance
of returning back home.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.210
- [Hiiragi] What are you talking about?
- So just stay right here.

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:27.000
- [Hiiragi] I wanna stay with you!
- Hiiragi...

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:28.090
[Hiiragi] Why are you...

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:31.430
[sighs softly] I'm so glad
I got to meet you, Hiiragi.

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:32.840
[footsteps approaching]

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:33.930
[gasps]

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.890
[banging at door]

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.860
[Hiiragi, sadly] Tsumugi.

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.120
- [distant bang]
- Oh!

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.660
[grunts] Help me!

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.500
If you can hear me, please open the door!

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.580
- Is anyone out there?
- [banging at door]

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.550
- [Hiiragi] Let me out of here, please!
- [banging continues]

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.130
Who's that yelling in there?

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.720
My name is Hiiragi!

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.640
Sorry, but... would you please let me out?

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.180
[gasps] Oh, wait, it's Hiiragi.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.640
I'm glad you're not dead.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.140
[quietly] Uh? Is that Tsumugi's dad?

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.190
[Izuru] Why are you in there?

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:27.400
[Hiiragi] 'Cause of Tsumugi.
She locked me in.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.730
[child] Whoa! [laughing]

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.580
[Izuru distantly]
Do you know where she went?

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:33.330
- [child] Huh?
- [Hiiragi] She's planning...

01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:35.740
I'll say once you let me out.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.410
Hey, sis, I can hear people
talkin' through the walls.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.260
[Izuru] The only reason Tsumugi
came back here was to try and save you.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:44.710
If she's locked you in here, that means
she doesn't want to involve you in this...

01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:49.420
[through speakers] ...any more than she has.
You should think about how Tsumugi feels.

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.420
[Hiiragi] I know.

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.880
I want to value Tsumugi's feelings. I do.

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:56.970
But...

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.390
I've realized that
my feelings have value too!

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:05.390
My whole life, I've always gone
with what the people around me wanted.

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.650
It became second nature.
I stopped questioning it.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.150
But then I met Tsumugi
and traveled with her.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.950
It's thanks to her that I've learned
how important it is

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:18.910
to trust in your own feelings.

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:21.660
Hm! I wanna help Tsumugi see this through!

01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:24.000
And not because I was told to!

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:27.170
I might not be of much use to her.

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:28.830
I might even die.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.920
But still... I want to be with Tsumugi!

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:36.510
So, please, sir,
open the door and let me do this!

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.350
[metallic clank]

01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:45.520
Hiiragi, let's do this.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600
[music ends]

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:50.690
Huh? Why...

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.440
- [woman 1 sighs]
- [man 1] Oh.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:54.610
- Wear this.
- [Hiiragi] Oh.

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.990
- I'll guide you to the island.
- Yeah? Thanks so much. I owe you.

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.450
- [woman 2] Wear this too.
- I appreciate it.

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.450
- Good luck out there, okay? Be safe!
- Try not to die!

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.830
- [woman 2] Do take care.
- [man 2] All the best.

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:07.500
- Hm.
- Hm.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.710
Everyone, thanks for your support!

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960
Hm.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.630
[engine starts]

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.720
[upbeat music playing]

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.720
- Sorry for the wait. Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.850
- [Hiiragi] Thank you.
- I wondered about this myself.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.520
Izuru, hop on behind me.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.730
- You ride with her, Hiiragi.
- 'Kay!

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:34.780
Thanks again, ma'am.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.780
- Did you track down Tsumugi?
- Uh... yes.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.860
- But she kinda ended up ditching me.
- [scoffs]

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:43.330
I see. Well, some of us like to be chased.

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.490
- [gasps]
- Let's go.

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.000
[engine revving]

01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:51.210
[music intensifies]

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:08.770
Tsumugi.

01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:10.350
[wind whistling]

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.530
[sighs] Oh no.

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:22.570
The village.

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.670
Hiiragi.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.830
- [man] We'll go on foot from here.
- [music ends]

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.130
[panting]

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:17.840
This is the path to the shrine.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.050
Or it should be.

01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:22.590
[wind whistling]

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:24.590
[Snow God wails]

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.510
Huh?

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:27.720
[dark dramatic music playing]

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.100

- [gasps]

[music intensifies]

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:01.380
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.130
There are so many of them.

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:08.430
- You guys go ahead.
- [Hiiragi grunts]

01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:14.980
[Izuru yelps]

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:22.400
- [Hiiragi] Izuru!
- You'll have to go on without us, Hiiragi!

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.240
Follow the wind tunnel,
and you'll reach Oni Island!

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:27.660
But I...

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.620
I trust you to find Tsumugi!

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.160
[man] We need to fall back!

01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:35.370
Aoi, hurry and get word to Gozen!
Don't wait for us!

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.580
Wasn't gonna!

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:41.090
- [thoughtful music playing]
- [Tsumugi breathing shakily, panting]

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.270
Hm? This smell...

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.360
[Snow God wails distantly]

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.620
"Follow the wind tunnel." [gasps]

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.620
[Snow God wails]

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:31.340

[mystical music playing]

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.780
[Tsumugi] Is this...

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:53.490
It's Oni Island.

01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:58.750
I'm here, Mom.

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:15.310
It's a hot spring.

01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:28.900
[Hiiragi groaning]

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.210
- [loud whoosh]
- [gasps]

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:43.710
[Hiiragi moaning]

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:48.960
[groans shakily]

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.810
[shakily] Oh. [moans, gasps]

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:03.850
Is that the shrine?

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.020
[gasps]

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.070
Tsumugi.

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:11.440
Tsumugi!

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.510
[Gozen] Then we're sure they won't come
by way of the northern shrine path.

01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:33.590
So let's send
our security teams to the Second Bridge.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.260
If we split the Snow Gods up,
we can assign two people to each of them.

01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:38.350
Right!

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:42.270
Go tell everyone! Leave the North Gate
and defend the Second Bridge!

01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:43.520
Right!

01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:53.150
[moaning softly]

01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:16.010
[sighs]

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.810
- [moans, gasps]
- [bells ringing chaotically]

01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:30.570
[whimpering]

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:35.320
[yells]

01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:46.580
[ethereal music playing]

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:53.840
If we end up with a girl,
then what do you think of "Tsumugi"?

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:56.420
Wait, that was Dad.

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:00.550
- Oh, what a cute name. [gasps]
- Oh!

01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:02.680
- I felt a kick.
- [gasps] Did you?

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.100
- [Tsumugi] Mom!
- I guess the baby likes it too.

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.230
[moaning]

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:09.100
[baby crying]

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:11.480
[Tsumugi] Is that... me?

01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:15.940
Where'd Daddy go? Boo!

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.610
[giggling]

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.700
Where are you, Mom?

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:22.530
Are you in here?

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:27.750
[woman] We'll never forget
the sacrifice you've made for us!

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:29.540
[man] Our future is in your hands.

01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:32.880
I have no doubt
that you're going to make us all proud.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.710
[Mom echoing] Tsumugi... I'm sorry.

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:39.970
[gasps]

01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:43.010
[Mom] But I have to protect everyone.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.770
[Tsumugi giggling]

01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:49.850
[Mom] Tsumugi...

01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:05.410
[man] The Snow Gods
are blessing us once more!

01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:07.910
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you too.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.410
[people chatter]

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.420
- Hey, I brought food.
- Thank you very much.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.920
Go have fun, but be careful.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.170
- [man sighs]
- [Mom] They all look so happy.

01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:21.180
I made the right choice, didn't I?

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:24.930
- [kids] Oni in! Fortune in!
- [man] Ow!

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.430
[Mom] I wish I was with them.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.940
Why only me?

01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:42.950
I've had enough.

01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:47.200
[menacing whoosh]

01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:49.700
[Snow Gods wailing]

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.840
- [Snow God screeching]
- [Aoi grunting]

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.850
[Tsumugi] Mom.

01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:09.180
I've realized that
I never knew anything about you.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.680
I was just blindly angry.

01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:15.110
[wavering] I painted you as a bad person.

01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:17.610
Because that would mean
it wasn't my fault.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.360
The fact that
you weren't with us wouldn't be my fault.

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:24.360
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.870
- Mom, I'm so sorry!
- [gasps]

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.870
Tsumugi? Is it really you? Where are you?

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.160
I'm right here!

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.380
It's okay, Mom! I found you!

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:37.460
[music intensifies]

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.380
Tsumugi!

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.880
Over here, Mom!

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.260
[panting]

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.140
Tsumugi.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.970
I'm so sorry.

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:54.190
You're the most important thing
in the world to me, so how could I...

01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:57.150
how could I let myself abandon you?
[sobbing]

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:01.530
It's all right, Mom. Let's just... go... home.

01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:03.700
- [Mom continues sobbing]
- Dad's waiting for us.

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.280
I've got a lot to catch you up on.

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:10.200
- And there's someone I want you to meet.
- [Mom continues sobbing]

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.950
- [music fades out]
- [rumbling fades in]

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040
Huh?

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.380
What is this? Tsumugi!

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:37.730
It'll all be buried!

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:07.970
[rumbling fades out]

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:15.680
[moaning] What happened?

01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:16.770
It's so dark.

01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:19.940
Oh yeah. I was caught in an avalanche.

01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:23.110
[grunting] I can't... move at all.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.860
[breathing shakily]

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.660
Huh?

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.330
It feels so warm.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.880
[grunts, sighs]

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.380
Wait, these are Hiiragi's footprints.

01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:51.760
[thoughtful piano music playing]

01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:54.510
[gasps]

01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:01.400
[Tsumugi] Oh, uh, I wasn't planning on it.

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:03.650
We'll go together. [echoes]

01:28:03.730 --> 01:28:06.820
[Tsumugi] No, we won't.
You need to stay here where it's safe.

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:07.900
[gasps]

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.660
[echoing] You gotta guide me
to the Hie Shrine, okay?

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:25.460
- Why are you following me?
- 'Cause you left me no choice.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:29.090
I'm a hard worker.
Please let us stay. You won't regret it.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.100
[chuckles softly] I made it this far
'cause you were here with me, Hiiragi.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.560
Tsumugi... Please, she needs help!

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.310
[Hiiragi] Thank you! For everything!

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.600
[Tsumugi] See you later!

01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:44.980
Bye-bye!

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.070
[Tsumugi] I am who I am

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:49.320
'cause of the connections I made
with the people I met.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.780
I'm so glad I got to meet you, Hiiragi.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.070
If they're still a part of me,
then you and I are still connected!

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240
Hiiragi!

01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:00.830
I really just wanna make sure that
I do my best for you.

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.540
[Tsumugi] Hiiragi!

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:07.420
Hiiragi!

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:11.420
[gasps]

01:29:12.010 --> 01:29:13.010
Hiiragi!

01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:17.760
- [grunts]
- Oh! [moans]

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.480
[Hiiragi] I don't mind
covering her bus fare.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.560
I... if that's okay?

01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:29.980
- [driver] What is this? Are you with her?
- [Hiiragi] Yeah. I am.

01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:31.900
- [snow crunching]
- [Hiiragi] Tsumugi!

01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:33.610
Tsumugi!

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:37.030
Tsumugi. Hey.

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:39.490
[gasps] Oh, thank goodness.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.450
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.210
How are you here?

01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:45.170
- Hiiragi...
- [piano music playing]

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.170
While I was locked inside that pantry,

01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:49.960
I had a lot of time
to think about what I actually wanted.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.340
I decided to start valuing
my true feelings.

01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.340
That gave me strength,
and everyone supported me.

01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:58.930
What do you mean by your "true feelings"?

01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:00.010
Well, uh...

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:04.190
- That I wanna be with you, Tsumugi!
- Wait, you mean, like...

01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:05.270
[wind howling]

01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:06.480
[music intensifies]

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.400
[both gasping]

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.820
Just hang on!

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900
[gasps]

01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:19.740
[music intensifies]

01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:28.460
[Snow God wails]

01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:32.170
[Aoi] What the...

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:40.260
- [Izuru] Shion!
- [gasps]

01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:41.930
[Shion] Izuru!

01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:45.100
What's going on? You okay?

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.400
[Shion] It's Tsumugi!
She hasn't come back!

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.810
Wait. Does that mean she found you?

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.230
Uh, look there.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320
[Shion gasps]

01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:56.570
[Izuru] Tsumugi?

01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:00.070
[both chuckle]

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.290
Mom, you're here!

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.960
Tsumugi!

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:16.300
Hi there, Mom. Welcome back.

01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:18.720
It's so good to be back.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800
You're all grown up.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.560
Mm.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.100
[Shion] I'm sorry
I made you feel so alone.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.150
Honestly, I did convince myself
I was alone.

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:30.900
But

01:31:32.190 --> 01:31:33.400
I had Dad with me.

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:36.570
And I met Hiiragi too.

01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:40.320
So, the truth is,
I was barely alone for a second.

01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:41.910
I'm okay.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.950
I see. I'm so glad to hear that.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.120
- Let's go home now.
- Sure.

01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:49.710
Do you wanna come with?

01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:52.710
I think... I should go.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.130
- Oh, right.
- [gentle piano music playing]

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.340
Go on, Hiiragi.

01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:59.970
Hm.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.640
[Tsumugi] Hiiragi!

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.310
Thanks for everything!

01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:19.240
Oh, and Hiiragi!

01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:22.110
Have a safe journey home!

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.660
Hiiragi, wait!

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.830
Say hi to your sister for me!

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.250
Hiiraaagiiiii!

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.340
- [man 1] Hurry up!
- [man 2] I am!

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.510
Hm.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:44.470
I suppose the Hidden Village
will just have to adapt.

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:45.560
[music ends]

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:56.310
[groans]

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.280
[Dad] Hm?

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.780
[gasps] Hiiragi!

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.740
It's you!
Where have you been this whole time?

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.740
You're not hurt, are you?
I've been so worried.

01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:10.830
- Where are those two...
- Listen, Dad. I'm sorry I worried you.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.040
I've got a lot of things
I'd like to tell you.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.630
- Let's go home.
- Mm.

[music fades out]

01:34:41.210 --> 01:34:42.210
Hm.

01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:55.940
- [horn blares]
- Hm?

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.520
Bus is now departing.

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.360
[doors hiss shut]

01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:07.530
[Tsumugi] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! I'm getting off!

01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:15.710
Wha... Tsumugi?

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.540
Tsumugi!

01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:21.210
Oh! Hi, Hiiragi. Just where have you been?

01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:23.050
[groaning] Uh... huh?

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:26.220
Care to explain why you never visited?

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.510
Wha... I tried! But every time
I walked through the entrance,

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:32.100
it just... led me to some other place.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:36.520
- Oh... right! Only oni can get through it.
- Ah.

01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:38.600
[Tsumugi] By the way,

01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:41.480
were you able
to talk things out with your dad?

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:45.530
Mm. It's honestly
still a work in progress.

01:35:45.610 --> 01:35:46.610
But we're okay now.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.490
One more thing. This is yours.

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.660
[Tsumugi] Thanks.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.460
So, Hiiragi. Speaking of

01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:01.250
communicating feelings,
I came to share mine.

01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:03.340
Uh?

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.800
[Hiiragi] Uh, wait! You mean...

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.970
- Let me go first!
- [Tsumugi] No, no, no, no, no!

01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:10.970
It's my turn, for sure. Right?
